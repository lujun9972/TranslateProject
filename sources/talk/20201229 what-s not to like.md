what's not to like
======

I've just discovered [Codeberg][1], a code hosting site that, _finally_, has let me create a user with plain emacs-w3m, shows me content reasonably well there, with a refreshingly uncluttered layout, handles graciously org files (why, it's even generating a table of contents for me), has a good privacy policy, it's not under the wings of any corporation and had my preferred username free for grabs.

So i'm definitely testing the waters for it to become my default site for (newish) published code: here's my [jao/elibs: Emacs libraries and little utilities][2] repository for starters (and, if you look closely, you'll find also my emacs config nearby). If and when that happens, they're going to [to get my humble contribution too][3], i reckon.
