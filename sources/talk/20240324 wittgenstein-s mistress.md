wittgenstein's mistress
======

![][1]

It took me twenty or thirty pages to really _enter_ in this book, but once I got in its mood I had a truly great time. It includes a subliminal tour over classic literature, painting and philosophy all in a truy original narrative voice. Foster Wallace's afterword has also some interesting bits, once you pardon him his pretentiousness (definitely a much better writer than critic). And remember, the protagonist is _not_ called Helen.
