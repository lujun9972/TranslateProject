el infinito en un junco
======

![][1]

If you can read Spanish, i wouldn't miss the opportunity to read this beautfiul essay in the original: Irene Vallejo's prose is clear, elegant and very beautiful. It's a delight (and a relief) to read. And, if you can't read Spanish but have a translation handy, i wouldn't miss the opportunity to read it either, for a very entertaining account of the history of ancient books sprinkled with lots of interesting (to me, at least!) bits about the Greek and Roman worlds. The book is morever wrapped in a subdued and sober optimism that i've found reinvigorating and sorely needed in these times, when one often feels like running on empty. Heartily recommended!
