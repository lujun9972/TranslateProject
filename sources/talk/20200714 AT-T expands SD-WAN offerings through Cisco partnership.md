sd-wan

AT&amp;T has expanded its SD-WAN offerings with a worldwide service based on Cisco Secure SD-WAN technology, and it natively integrates threat protection across branch offices and [hybrid clouds][1] without compromising performance.

AT&amp;T's managed service offers application-aware dynamic routing and integration with existing networks including MPLS, LTE, and internet broadband. It provides zero-touch provisioning, optimized cloud connectivity and visibility into network applications performance. All of these features are valuable to enterprises moving toward a hybrid/multi-cloud environment.

AT&amp;T now offers three SD-WAN services. The first is its own network-based SD-WAN platform, and the other is based on VMware's VeloCloud for SD-WAN services that was [introduced in 2016][2].

Cisco Secure is built on Cisco’s secure SD-WAN service powered by Viptela, which [Cisco acquired three years ago][3]. Cisco Secure is available on Cisco’s line of Integrated Service Routers (ISRs) and Aggregated Service Routers (ASRs), both of which [just got an upgrade][4].

Cisco Secure is also available through Cisco’s Enterprise Network Compute System (ENCS) of appliances and can be managed through a single cloud-based dashboard, Cisco’s vManage controller. Integrated security features include an application-aware enterprise firewall, intrusion prevention, URL filtering and advanced malware protection. AT&amp;T Managed Services will work with AT&amp;T Cybersecurity to support and manage the new service.

“Successful network and digital transformation requires effective security management,” said Mo Katibeh, executive vice president, chief product &amp; platform officer for AT&amp;T Business in a statement. “AT&amp;T SD-WAN with Cisco combines connectivity, SD-WAN and security, which allows businesses to expand and scale without worrying about the security of their branch locations."

AT&amp;T customers can combine the SD-WAN offering with AT&amp;T’s WAN options, including AT&amp;T Virtual Private Network MPLS service, Dedicated or Shared Internet or LTE, all of which are under AT&amp;T management.
