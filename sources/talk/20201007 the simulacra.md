the simulacra
======

![][1]

Philip K. Dick is always deeply original, in a very curious kind of off-hand way. Every year i pick at random one or two of his short novels (he was [really prolific][2]), and i always find food for thought and, at the same time, uncomplicated fun. It's a peculiar combination, but one i unreservedly recommend (although of course if you haven't read yet masterpieces such as _Ubik_ or _The Man in the High Castle_, i'd start there).
