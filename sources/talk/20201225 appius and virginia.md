appius and virginia
======

![][1]

I recently learnt, at [The Neglected Books Page][2] (aptly subtitled _Where forgotten books are remembered)_, about G.E. Trevelyan, an author all but forgotten nowadays too. More concretely, I read about her first novel, [Appius and Virginia][3], and was very intrigued and happy to discover [in this video feature][4] that it was going to be re-printed by [Abandoned Books Press][5]. My copy arrived yesterday, and it's easily been the best book i've read this year. It's daring, original and exceptionally well-written. It reminds me of another of my favourites of all times, Aldous Huxley, or Woolf if she had tried to try her stream-of-consciousness experiments to the mind of an ape, or maybe Mary Shelley, had she imagined Frankenstein's creature as a puzzled orangutan.

G.E. Trevelyan died tragically due to a Nazi bomb, and had only time for 7 more novels. I'm looking forward to reading them!
