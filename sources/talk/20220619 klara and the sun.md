klara and the sun
======

![][1]

A nicely written (as always with Ishiguro) history of Stevens turned into an artificially intelligent being, in a near future reminiscent of _Never let me go_. In other words, i found this novel heavily inspired in previous works of the author, which i admittedly find better than this one, but that doesn't mean the book doesn't throw at you a bunch of provocative musings or lacks a tranquil beauty that makes it absolutely worth reading.
