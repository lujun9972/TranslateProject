Linux Foundation: Open Source Collaboration is a Global Endeavor
======

_The Linux Foundation would like to reiterate its statements and analysis of the application of US Export Control regulations to public, open collaboration projects (e.g. open source software, open standards, open hardware, and open data) and the importance of open collaboration in the successful, global development of the world’s most important technologies. At this time, we have no information to believe recent Executive Orders regarding WeChat and TikTok will impact our analysis for open source collaboration. Our members and other participants in our project communities, which span many countries, are clear that they desire to continue collaborating with their peers around the world._

As a reminder, we would like to point anyone with questions to our [prior blog post][1] on US export regulations, which also links to our [more detailed analysis][2] of the topic. Both are available in English and Simplified Chinese for the convenience of our audiences.
