The Linux Foundation’s First-Ever Virtual Open Source Summit (TechNewsWorld)
======

Jack M. Germain writes on Tech News World:

_The success of The Linux Foundation’s first virtual summit may well have set the standard for new levels of open source participation._

_Summit masters closed the virtual doors of the four-day joint gathering on July 2. The event hosted the **Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020** and ended with more than 4,000 registrants from 109 countries._

_The online platform [InXpo][1] enabled participants to be part of a real immersive technical gathering. They also can view on-demand content of sponsor resources and conference sessions for one year._

_The InXpo platform enabled attendees to:_

  *     * _View 250+ informative educational sessions and tutorials, across 14 different technology tracks, and participate in live Q&amp;A;_
    * _Join the ‘hallway track’ and collaborate via topic-based networking lounges in group chats, and connect with attendees in 1:1 chats;_
    * _Visit the 3D virtual sponsor showcase and booths to speak directly with company representatives, view demos, download resources, view job openings and share contact info._



_The summit’s virtual format also provided attendees the chance to “[gamify][2]” their event experience by earning points and winning prizes for attending sessions, visiting sponsor booths, and answering trivia questions._
