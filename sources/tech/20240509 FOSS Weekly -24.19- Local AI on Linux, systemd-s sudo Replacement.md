FOSS Weekly #24.19: Local AI on Linux, systemd's sudo Replacement
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

It is time to embrace the AI 🤖

While the world can gush over the likes of proprietary ChatGPT, we Linux users should look for its open source alternatives.

The thing is that running an AI server on your system locally has become a lot easier as long as you have a dedicated GPU.

Earlier, you learned about [Python based PrivateGPT][3]. This Ollama tool is even better for local AI. I took it for a test recently and the feeling of owning your AI server is soul satisfying.

I'll be exploring the open source AI side further. Testing different tools and finding good use cases where running local AI can help home users who are not necessarily coders. Of course, I'll share my findings with you 😄

  * Ubuntu 24.04 post-install tips.
