Contribute to Rawhide Test Days – DNF 5
======

![Fedora 41 DNF5][1]

Fedora Rawhide test days are events where anyone can help make sure changes in Fedora Linux work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members often participate, and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed to Fedora Linux before, this is a perfect way to get started.

For some time, we have been trying to elevate the quality of Fedora by testing things well ahead of time. The Fedora Changes process lets people submit changesets well before the release process starts and many developers try their best to create a timeline for the new changes to land. We in the Quality team figured out we should also be able to execute test days for the changesets, which are crucial for us and will likely help us identify bugs very early. This will ensure a smoother and cleaner release process and also help us stay on track with on-time releases.

To kick off this effort, we would like to start with testing DNF 5, which is a [changeset][2] proposed for Fedora Linux 41. Since the brand new _dnf5_ package has landed in rawhide, we would like to organize a test week to get some initial feedback on it before it becomes the default. We will be testing DNF5 according to its [basic acceptance criteria][3] to iron out any rough edges.

The test days will be **Friday, March 15th through Tuesday, March 19th**. The test week page is available [here][4].

Happy testing, and we hope to see you on one of the test days.
