From Kernel Development Student to SysAdmin to Linux Author
======

In 2016, Ahmed Alkabary had just graduated from the University of Regina, where he earned degrees in computer science and mathematics. He began using Linux in the second year of his studies and quickly developed such a passion for it that he began extra studies outside of university to advance his skills. Ahmed’s enthusiasm for Linux even led him to develop a free course on Udemy to teach it to others; nearly 50,000 students have enrolled to date. Following the completion of his studies, Ahmed hoped to secure a job as a Linux system administrator.

Ahmed applied for and was selected as the recipient of a LiFT scholarship in the category of Academic Aces, which enabled him to enroll in the Linux Kernel Internals and Development (LFD420) training course and the Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin exam.
