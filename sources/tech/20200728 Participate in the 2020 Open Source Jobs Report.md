Participate in the 2020 Open Source Jobs Report!
======

[The Linux Foundation][1] has partnered with [edX][2] to update the Open Source Jobs Report, which was last produced in [2018][3]. The report examines the latest trends in open source careers, which skills are in demand, what motivates open source job seekers, and how employers can attract and retain top talent. In the age of COVID-19, this data will be especially insightful both for companies looking to hire more open source talent, as well as individuals looking to advance or change careers.

The report is anchored by two surveys, one of which explores what hiring managers are looking for in employees, and one focused on what motivates open source professionals. Ten respondents to each survey will be randomly selected to receive a US$100 gift card to a leading online retailer as a thank you for participating!

All those working with open source technology, or hiring folks who do, are encouraged to share your thoughts and experiences. The surveys take around 10 minutes to complete, and all data is collected anonymously. Links to the surveys are at the top and bottom of this post.
