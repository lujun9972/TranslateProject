FOSS Weekly #24.43: Coreboot Fiasco, Joplin Tips, Android-Linux Connect, Fedora Offline Update and More
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

I have been using Linux since 2009. Over the past 15 years, I have come across numerous distributions. I have also seen the demise of several interesting Linux distros and websites (I Love Ubuntu, Muktware, Webupd8 and many more).

Last week, Ankush and I were discussing Crunchbang, a popular distro that got discontinued around 2014. That discussion led to this quick article to remember some of the discontinued that were quite popular back then.

## 💡 Quick Handy Tip

Ubuntu has a default tiling assistant installed, but it has limited customization possibilities. If you have [extension manager][26] installed, then you can do something about it.

Open it and click on the settings button near the tiling assistant extension.

From here, you can tweak additional tiling settings like window gaps, screen edges keybindings, etc.

Similarly, other preinstalled extensions like Ubuntu dock can also be tweaked using the extension settings in extension manager.
