Interview with KubeCF project leaders Dieu Cao and Paul Warren
======

KubeCF is a distribution of Cloud Foundry Application Runtime (CFAR) for Kubernetes. Originated at SUSE, the project is a bridge between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. KubeCF provides developers the productivity they love from Cloud Foundry and allows platform operators to manage the infrastructure abstraction with Kubernetes tools and APIs. To learn more about the project we hosted a discussion with Dieu Cao, CF Open Source Product Lead at VMware, and Paul Warren, Product Manager cf-for-k8s at VMWare.
