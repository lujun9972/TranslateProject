Distributed Identity Foundation (DIF) January 2021 Highlights
======

_DIF held its semiannual “Face-to-Face” community’ event last week, and man what an event it was! For obvious reasons, it was virtual for the second time, and for the first time, it spanned both Zoom and the interactive social platform [gather.town][1], giving a more intimate atmosphere and allowing for more organic networking than often happens at “tele-conferences.”_
