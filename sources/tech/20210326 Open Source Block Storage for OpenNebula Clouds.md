Open Source Block Storage for OpenNebula Clouds
======

_**This post was contributed by [LINBIT][1]**_

The LINBIT OpenNebula TechDays is our mutual attempt to share our combined knowledge with the open source and storage community. We want to give you a thorough understanding of combining LINBIT’s software-defined storage solution with OpenNebula clouds.

[**OpenNebula**][2] is a powerful, but easy-to-use, open source platform to build and manage Enterprise Clouds. OpenNebula provides unified management of IT infrastructure and applications, avoiding vendor lock-in and reducing complexity, resource consumption, and operational costs. In contrast to OpenStack, which understands itself as a collection of independent projects, OpenNebula is an integrated solution that provides all the necessary components to manage a private, hybrid, or edge cloud.

[**LINBIT SDS**][3] is a software-defined storage solution for Linux that delivers highly-available, replicated block-storage volumes with exceptional performance. It matches perfectly with OpenNebula.

**Both open source, both born in the Linux software ecosystem.** LINBIT SDS is perfectly suited for a hyper-converged deployment with OpenNebula’s hypervisor nodes since it saves a lot on CPU and memory resources when you compare it to Ceph. At the same time, it delivers higher performance (IOPS and throughput) for single volumes and accumulated over all volumes of a cluster.

Find all webinars, case-studies, and discussions listed in the TechDays schedule. It is a free all-virtual event on April 20th and 21st, with direct access to LINBIT and OpenNebula experts.

[See you there!][4]
