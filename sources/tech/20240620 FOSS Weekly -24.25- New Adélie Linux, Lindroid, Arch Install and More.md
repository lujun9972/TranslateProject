FOSS Weekly #24.25: New Adélie Linux, Lindroid, Arch Install and More
======

An interesting project appeared on my timeline. It's called Lindroid and it aims to let users run Linux distros inside Android in a new way. Check it out.

By the way, the 12th-anniversary offer of the free '[Linux for DevOps][4]' ebook is still continuing. 29 new Plus members joined us last week. We are aiming for 50 new members and thus the offer is extended for this one week.

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition:**

  * A new independent distro, Adélie Linux
  * Resetting forgotten root password in Ubuntu
  * System monitor Mission Center has new updates
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!
  * This edition of FOSS Weekly is supported by [Warp][6].

## 💡 Quick handy tip

On the GNOME Extensions Manager App, you can check whether the installed extensions are compatible with newer GNOME releases.

Open the app, and from the top-right hamburger menu, select “ _Upgrade Assistant_ ”.

![][22]

Now, from the new window, select the required GNOME version and click on “ _Check Compatibility_ ”.

![][23]

It will give you an overview of your installed extensions and their compatibility with the GNOME version you selected.

If you don't know what the Extension Manager is, refer to our [detailed guide][24] on it.
