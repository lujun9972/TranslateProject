Bagisto: An Open Source eCommerce Platform
======

_**Brief: Bagisto is a relatively new open-source eCommerce platform built on Laravel. Let’s see what it has got to offer.**_

### Bagisto: Free &amp; Open Source eCommerce Platform Built On Laravel

![][1]

I have discussed some of the [best open-source eCommerce platforms][2] to build shopping websites in the past. Recently, I came to know about a new platform called [Bagisto][3]. It’s built on [Laravel][4], which is a free and open-source PHP framework.

On the first look, it’s impressive to find an open-source eCommerce solution that lets you craft beautiful shopping experiences. Hence, I decided to give a quick look on what it offers and if it’s something that you can try.

### Features of Bagisto

Of course, just like any other eCommerce solutions, you should expect the essential options available to build a basic online shopping website. In this case, I think it ticks all the boxes for the basic requirements while also providing some useful/advanced options.

  * Ability to create a marketplace to allow other vendors to sell their products
  * Multi-store inventory to easily manage the stock you have in a physical retail store and a warehouse depending on your business
  * Search Engine Optimization options for your products
  * Access control level to prevent unnecessary access to agents, shopping partners, or an admin.
  * Detailed insights report for effective marketing campaigns and improvements
  * Add/manage shipping methods
  * [RTL][6] supported system
  * Customer group options
  * Easy cart management
  * Multiple Payment methods supported
  * Convert your web experience into a Progressive Web App for mobile phones
  * Store pick up options (for businesses with physical stores)
  * Multi-currency support
  * Multi-language support
  * Tax calculation support
  * Several extensions to support mobile number login, Stripe payment gateway, dropshipping, [Point of Sale][7] and other options to extend the functionality



### Getting Started with Bagisto

![][8]

To get started using Bagisto, you need to first go through the [documentation][9] looking at the server requirements.

You can choose to deploy it locally for a test run or install it on your server after ensuring that it meets the minimum requirements. In either case, you can also take a look at their [live demo][10] to explore it.

If you’re going to self-host it, you should note that Instead of creating a standalone Bagisto image, they are using a hybrid method of running composer on an Apache PHP image.

So, yes, you can deploy it via Docker as well. You will also find their [GitHub page][11] for docker implementation useful with the necessary instructions.

If you’re curious to learn more, you can check out their recent video on the latest release (at the time of writing this):
