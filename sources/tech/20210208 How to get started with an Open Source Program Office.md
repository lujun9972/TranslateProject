How to get started with an Open Source Program Office
======

Today every company has to be a software company to be functional in today’s world and open source has become the preferred model for software development. However, many companies still don’t know how to properly engage with the open source communities and code-base. Lack of any strategy towards open source not only keeps companies from taking full advantage of Open Source, it also exposes their own IP or code-base to many risks, including the violation of Open Source license. Every company that deals with Open Source should have an Open Source Program Office. However, there is no playbook to create one. The Linux Foundation Training &amp; Certification has released a new seven-course, training series entitled “Open Source Management &amp; Strategy”. The course is authored by seasoned Open Source leader  Guy Martin, Executive Director of OASIS Open, an internationally recognized standards development and open source projects consortium.
