### Half of the Fedora backpacks were for free

After delivering more than 800 embroidered [Fedora garments][2] to more than 50 countries, we’d like to share some numbers about our Fedora shirt project.

Our most popular items are of course shirts: 266 T-shirts, and 267 polo shirts were sold and there are 30 [Fedora laptop backpacks][7] around the world. Half of them were gifts from us to people ordering four or more other items (shirts or sweatshirts). You can still get a backpack too.

The most popular sizes are large (27%) and extra large (26%), followed by medium (19%) and 2XL (16%).

Since we ship worldwide, our Fedora garments are in 53 countries. Most of them in the United States (33%), Germany (14%), United Kingdom (5%) and France (5%). But can you find Moldova, Macao, Ghana or Réunion on the map? Fedora users show their commitment to our favorite operating system with Fedora shirts in these countries and territories too.
