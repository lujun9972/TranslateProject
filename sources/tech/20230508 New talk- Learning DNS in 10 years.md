New talk: Learning DNS in 10 years
======

Here’s a keynote I gave at [RubyConf Mini][1] last year: Learning DNS in 10 years. It’s about strategies I use to learn hard things. I just noticed that they’d released the video the other day, so I’m just posting it now even though I gave the talk 6 months ago.

Here’s the video, as well as the slides and a transcript of (roughly) what I said in the talk.
