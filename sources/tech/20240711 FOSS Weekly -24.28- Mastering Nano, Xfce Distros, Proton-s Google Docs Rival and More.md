FOSS Weekly #24.28: Mastering Nano, Xfce Distros, Proton's Google Docs Rival and More
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

I usually create quick, short videos of less than 5 minutes duration. But recently, I published a hands-on Nano editor guide that goes over 20 minutes.

That's rare for me. But if you like longer videos on a topic, perhaps I can create videos on Linux commands and Bash scripting. Please let me know your feedback 😄
