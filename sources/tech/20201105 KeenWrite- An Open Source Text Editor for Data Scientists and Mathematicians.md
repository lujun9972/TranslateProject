KeenWrite: An Open Source Text Editor for Data Scientists and Mathematicians
======

_**Brief: An interesting text editor that supports R markdown. With codes in R, you can add string interpolation, graphs and other mathematical expressions to your text document.**_

### KeenWrite: A Useful Open Source Markdown Editor With R Code Support

There are several open-source Markdown editors available for Linux but KeenWrite is a bit interesting with the string interpolation and [R markdown][2] support.

Not just limited to that, it also supports real-time preview and a bunch of other features particularly helpful for academics in mathematics, statistics and other related fields.

### Features of KeenWrite

![][3]

To give you an overview, let me go through the features it offers. You can also watch the official video below to get a better idea:

  * Real-time preview with variable substitution
  * R Markdown support
  * Uses [String interpolation][4]
  * Mathematical expression support
  * Auto-complete variable names
  * Write mathematical formulas using a subset of TeX
  * Spellcheck feature
  * Inline Code support
  * Code block
  * Essential formatting options that include superscript, subscript
  * Gives you the ability to add pictures, quotes, links
  * Export options include Markdown, HTML/SVG, and HTML/Tex
  * Available on Windows and Linux



This video by its developer describes the features in detail:

### Installing KeenWrite on Linux

Unfortunately, there’s no .deb or Flatpak package to get it installed on Linux distributions. But, there is a binary file available that you can download and run to get started.

You need to head to its [GitHub page][5], download the .bin file and the follow the instructions mentioned there or type in the following commands (assuming Downloads is the directory where the file gets stored):

```
cd Downloads
chmod +x keenwrite.bin
./keenwrite.bin
```

### My Thoughts on KeenWrite

![][6]

Even though I miss a dark mode on KeenWrite, the feature set seems useful enough. You get to tweak the font size, image file format support, definitions, and the configuration for using R Markdown.

In either case, we have a lot of Markdown editors available for Linux. So, if this does not suit your needs, feel free to explore our list of [best Markdown editors][7] as well.
