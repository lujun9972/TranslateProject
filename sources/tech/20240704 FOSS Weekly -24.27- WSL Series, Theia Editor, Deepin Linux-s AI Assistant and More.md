FOSS Weekly #24.27: WSL Series, Theia Editor, Deepin Linux's AI Assistant and More
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

We have a new tutorial series and this one is on WSL. With WSL, people can use Linux command line inside Windows. It is a popular tool among students and developers. Many people are getting their first experience of Linux commands with WSL so it was about time that we created some good resources on it.

[It's FOSS WSL series][3] covers all the essentials in nine tutorials.

You can find the series on the homepage along with [Terminal Basics][5] and [Bash series][6]. I hope you enjoy these tutorial series as much as we like creating them 😄

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition**

  * A simple markdown note-taking app.
  * Proton VPN being made more accessible.
  * The Raspberry Pi 5 being humbled by another SBC.
  * EndeavourOS celebrating their five-year anniversary.
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!

## 💡 Quick handy tip

In Firefox, you can force the websites to use custom fonts. First open settings, then under the _General_ tab, scroll down to the _Fonts_ section.

![][20]

Here, click on _Advanced_ , where you can set different font categories here. Now, uncheck the “ _Allow pages to choose their own fonts…_ ” checkbox, and click _OK_.

![][21]

Now, sites will load with your selected fonts.

🚧

Don't use this if you are working with graphics and font related things. Because apps like Canva, online Office suites etc. won't show other fonts.

## 🤣 Meme of the week

A meme that reflects the current state of open-source contributions. 😥
