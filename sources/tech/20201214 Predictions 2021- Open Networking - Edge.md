Predictions 2021: Open Networking & Edge
======

![][1]

As we wrap up 2020, I wanted to take a moment to look at where the industry is headed and what we’ve learned this year. ****

### **Telecom &amp; Cloud ‘Plumbing’ based on 5G Open Source will drive accelerated investments from top markets (Government, Manufacturing, and Enterprises) **

This broad acceptance of open networking stacks shows the true power of what is possible when fat, fast, and functional features are at your fingertips. _See information on_ [_ONAP’s Guilin_][2] _release,_ [_EdgeX Foundry’s Hanoi release_][3]_, and_ [_this recent post from FierceTelecom_][4]_._

### **The Last piece of the “open” puzzle will fall in place: Radio Access Network (RAN)**

The final closed architecture in the 148- year- old Telecom industry — the RAN — is finally open!  2021 will bring the first build-outs of open RAN technology in close collaboration with Edge and Core. _Visit the_ [_O-RAN Software Community_][5] *for more information. *

### “**Remote Work” will continue to be the greatest positive distraction, especially within the open source community**

LFN and LFE saw about 25-40% Growth in Developers and Contribution during 2020, and we expect the pace to pick up to almost **50%** as more vertical industries embrace open source technologies. _See_ [_Software Defined Vertical Industries: Transformation Through Open Source_][6]*, a Linux Foundation white paper. *

### **“Futures” (aka bells and whistle features &amp; future-looking capabilities) will give way to “functioning blueprints”  **

Open source interoperability, compliance &amp; verification for rapid deployment becomes the highest priority in 2021 beyond software. _See the_ [_latest Blueprints from LF Edge’s Akraino project_][7]_, as well as information on OPNFV + CNTT’s latest integrations._

### **AI/ML technologies become mainstream **

[Closed loop control in an Intelligent Network][8] paves the way for Intent-based Networking, and [Predictive Maintenance][9] emerges as a top use case in Edge using AI/ML.  **What do you expect 2021 will bring to the open networking and edge table?**

**What did I miss?** I would love to have your comments on [LinkedIn][10].
