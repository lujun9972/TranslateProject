Linux Kernel Training Helps Security Engineer Move into Full Time Kernel Engineering
======

_In 2017, Mohamed Al Samman was working on the Linux kernel, doing analysis, debugging, and compiling. He had also built an open source Linux firewall, and a kernel module to monitor power supply electrical current status (AC/DC) by using the Linux kernel notifier. He hoped to become a full-time kernel developer, and expand the kernel community in Egypt, which led him to apply for, and be awarded, a Linux Foundation Training (LiFT) Scholarship in the Linux Kernel Guru category._

We followed up with Mohamed recently to hear what he’s been up to since completing his Linux Foundation training.
