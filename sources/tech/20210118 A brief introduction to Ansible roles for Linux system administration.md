Ansible is an open source automation platform that includes configuration management, application deployment, and infrastructure orchestration. It is a  popular automation tool for DevOps engineers and for system administrators. System administrators often face career burnout due to long hours and from performing repetitive tasks on many systems, but Ansible helps make these tasks easier to complete. Tasks such as user creation, service management, and software installs can be accomplished using Ansible.
