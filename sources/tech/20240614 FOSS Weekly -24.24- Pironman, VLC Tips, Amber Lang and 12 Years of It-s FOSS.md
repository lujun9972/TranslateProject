FOSS Weekly #24.24: Pironman, VLC Tips, Amber Lang and 12 Years of It's FOSS
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

It's FOSS turns 12 today 🎂

I started It's FOSS as a personal website to share my learning and experience with desktop Linux and open source software. Things have certainly changed in the last 12 years.

It's FOSS has been visited over 220 million times since its creation. It has helped countless people with Linux and that's the best thing of these 12 years.

With time, we have over 400,000 followers across social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, Mastodon, Telegram, YouTube and Instagram.

That's quite an achievement and I would like to thank each and every one of you for helping us reach these milestones 🙏

If you would like to share some words of appreciation, the [testimonial form is here][3]. I also invite your feedback, criticism and suggestions that will help us move forward in the right direction.

📣
