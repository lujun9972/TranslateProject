SEAPATH: A Software Driven Open Source Project for the Energy Sector
======

LF Energy recently announced a new project called, SEAPATH, or Software Enabled Automation Platform and Artifacts (THerein). It’s the second project by the foundation in its Digital Substation Automation Systems (DSAS) initiative. SEAPATH will provide a reference design and a real-time, open-source platform for grid operators to run virtualized automation and protection applications. In this interview, Dr. Shuli Goodman, Executive Director of LF Energy, and Lucian Balea, R&amp;D Program Director and open source manager at RTE joined Swapnil Bhartiya to talk about the project.
