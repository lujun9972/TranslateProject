Contribute at the Fedora 34 CoreOS Test Day
======

![Fedora 34 CoreOS Test Day][1]

The Fedora CoreOS team released the first [Fedora CoreOS _next_ stream][2] based on Fedora 34. They expect to promote this to the _testing_ stream in two weeks, on the usual schedule. As a result, the Fedora CoreOS and QA teams have organized a test week. It begins **Monday, April 26, 2021** and runs through the end of the week. Refer to the [wiki page][3] for links to the test cases and materials you’ll need to participate. Read below for details.

### How does a test day work?

A test day is an event where anyone can help make sure changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members often participate, and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed before, this is a perfect way to get started.

To contribute, you only need to be able to do the following things:

  * Download test materials, which include some large files
  * Read and follow directions step by step



The [wiki page][3] for the test day has a lot of good information on what and how to test. After you’ve done some testing, you can log your results in the test day [web application][4]. If you’re available on or around the day of the event, please do some testing and report your results.

Happy testing, and we hope to see you on test day.
