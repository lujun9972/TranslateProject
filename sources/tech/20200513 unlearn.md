unlearn
======

For years, i've been using `C-x p`, `C-x o` and `C-c <n>` to move to other windows, but with [ace window][1] i am substituting all of them with `M-o`. Problem is, muscle memory interferes and i find myself clumsily moving around (and often lost) with the former ones. Or i did, before i followed an advice from [Stefan Monnier][2] in emacs-devel: unbind those keys you want to forget, and you'll get an error when you relapse.

In my case, that was just

```

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") nil)

```

together with commeting out the other one's definitions. For the record, in Stefan's case, he was trying to remember to use the newer `C-h o` (symbol help) instead of `C-h f` (function help) or `C-h v` (variable help), so he unbound the last two.

After a while, when one's muscles have forgotten, one can re-enable the old bindings, for the few cases where they're justified.
