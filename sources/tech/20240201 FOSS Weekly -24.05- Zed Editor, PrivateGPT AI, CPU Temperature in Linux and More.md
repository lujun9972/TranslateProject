FOSS Weekly #24.05: Zed Editor, PrivateGPT AI, CPU Temperature in Linux and More
======

I promised at the beginning of 2024 that you'll see more exploring, homelab and hobbyist open source AI stuff this year along with the regular beginner-friendly tutorials.

In that regard, we have our first AI article published. It is about [setting up PrivateGPT AI][1] to interact with PDF documents. It's not written by me, that's another Abhishek.

With PrivateGPT, the data remains on your system and all the computation happens on your system.

I have also received the latest Raspberry Pi 5. Be prepared to see some Raspberry Pi tutorials as well 😄

By the way, if you are on Instagram, [do follow us there][2] as we are sharing plenty of reels (not the dancing ones, don't worry 😉 )

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

  * A new Budgie release.
  * Meta is betting big on its GitHub Copilot challenger.
  * A guide on monitoring Raspberry Pi temperature.
  * The creators of Atom have come up with something new.
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!
