How to Save Downloaded Files Automatically in Brave Browser
======

I always use two browsers on my system. Firefox is the primary browser and these days Brave is what I rely for my second browser.

[Brave browser][1] is an excellent choice for someone who wants a Chrome/Chromium feel without the Google touch. It blocks ads and trackers by default and warns you against websites, downloads and extensions that are known to be dangerous. It also has an optional cryptocurrency ecosystem to reward its users and web publishers.

I like Brave for a fast, smooth browsing experience. It works on smartphones as well. As I said, quite a good choice for a mainstream browser.

There is one minor annoyance with Brave browser. If you download any file, the default behavior is that it asks where to save the file on your computer.

![Brave browser asks where to save downloaded files each time][2]

It does this for every single file you try to download [using Brave browser in Linux][3] and probably in other operating systems as well.

This annoys the heck out of me and if you share the same feeling, let me tell you that you can easily change this behavior.

### Automatically save downloaded files in Brave browser

To get rid of this annoyance, here’s what you need to do.

Go to the download settings of Brave browser. You can either enter `brave://settings/downloads` in the address bar or access the Settings option from the hamburger menu.

And then, expand the Additional settings option to access the download settings. You’ll find a “Ask where to save each file before downloading” option with toggle button. Toggle this button off to start saving the downloaded files automatically.

You may also change the default download location in the settings here, if you want.

I know this is not something extraordinary and you might think if it really warranted an entire article. But here’s the thing. Many users bear these minor annoyances accepting it as default behavior. Only when coming across articles like this one, people realize that the behavior can be or should be modified.
