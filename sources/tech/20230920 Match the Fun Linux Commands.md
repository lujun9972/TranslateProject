Match the Fun Linux Commands
======

There are plenty of Linux commands that have no work related usage. I like to call them '[fun Linux commands][1]' and this quiz is about those commands.

You have to drag and drop the terminal outputs with their respective commands. Even if you don't know those commands, you can still guess them.

I think you can do this :)
