Contribute at the Fedora CoreOS Test Day
======

![Fedora 33 FCOS Test Week][1]

The Fedora 33 CoreOS Test Day focuses on testing FCOS based on Fedora 33. The FCOS **next** stream is already rebased on Fedora 33 content, which will be coming soon to **testing** and **stable**. To prepare for the content being promoted to other streams the Fedora CoreOS and QA teams have organized a test day on **Friday, November 06, 2020** (results accepted through **Thursday, November 12**). Refer to the [wiki page][2] for links to the test cases and materials you’ll need to participate. Read below for details.

### How does a test day work?

A test day is an event where anyone can help make sure changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members often participate, and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed before, this is a perfect way to get started.

To contribute, you only need to be able to do the following things:

  * Download test materials, which include some large files
  * Read and follow directions step by step



The [wiki page][2] for the test day has a lot of good information on what and how to test. After you’ve done some testing, you can log your results in the test day [web application][3]. If you’re available on or around the day of the event, please do some testing and report your results.

Happy testing, and we hope to see you on test day.
