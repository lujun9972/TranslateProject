A list of programming playgrounds
======

I really like using (and making!) programming playgrounds, and I got thinking the other day about how I didn’t have a great list of playgrounds to refer to. So I [asked on Mastodon][1] for links to cool playgrounds.

Here’s what I came up with. I’d love to know what I missed.

  * Compilers: [godbolt compiler explorer][2] by Matt Godbolt
  * Shaders: [shadertoy][3] by Inigo Quilez and Pol Jeremias
  * Arduino / IoT: [wokwi][4] from CodeMagic
  * CSS/HTML/JS: [CodePen][5] by Chris Coyier, Alex Vasquez, and team
  * CSS/HTML/JS: [JSFiddle][6] by Oskar Krawczyk and Piotr Zalewa
  * CSS/HTML/JS: [flems][7] by Rasmus Porsager (saves all state in the URL)
  * regular expressions:
    * for many languages: [regex101][8] by Firas Dib
    * for Ruby: [Rubular][9] by Michael Lovitt
    * for JS/PCRE: [regexr][10] by gskinner
    * for Python: [Pythex][11] by Gabriel Rodríguez
  * DNS: [Mess With DNS][12] by Julia Evans and Marie Flanagan
  * DNS: [DNS lookup tool][13] by Julia Evans
  * nginx: [nginx playground][14] by Julia Evans
  * varnish: [fastly fiddle][15] from fastly
  * SQLite: [sqlime][16] by Anton Zhiyanov (lets you load arbitrary SQLite databases)
  * SQL: [DB fiddle][17] from Status200
  * SQL: [sql playground][18] by Julia Evans
  * Postgres: [postgres playground][19] from Crunchydata (runs postgres in the browser!)
  * Git: [oh my git][20] by blinry and bleeptrack
  * .NET bytecode: [SharpLab][21] by Andrey Shchekin
  * Python bytecode: [dis this][22] by Pamela Fox



### data formats

  * Floating point: [Float Exposed][23] by Bartosz Ciechanowski
  * Unicode: [Unicode analyzer][24] from fontspace
  * Unicode: [What unicode character is this?][25] from babelstone
  * ASN.1 certificates: [ASN.1 JavaScript debugger][26] by Lapo Luchini
  * SVG: [sssvg (interactive SVG reference)][27] from [fffuel][28] (lots of other cool tools there)
  * CBOR: [CBOR playground][29]
  * cron: [crontab guru][30] from cronitor



### programming languages

  * official playgrounds:
    * [Go][31]
