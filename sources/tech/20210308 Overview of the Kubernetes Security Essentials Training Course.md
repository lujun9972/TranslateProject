Overview of the Kubernetes Security Essentials Training Course
======

We recently launched the [LFS260 – Kubernetes Security Essentials][1] eLearning course in partnership with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the home of Kubernetes. This course provides the skills and knowledge on a broad range of best practices for securing container-based applications and Kubernetes platforms during build, deployment and runtime. It also gets you ready to sit for the [Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)][2] exam.

In this new video, Linux Foundation Training &amp; Certification instructor Tim Serewicz, who created the eLearning course and was instrumental in creating the CKS exam, provides an overview of what you can expect during this training, with topics including:

  * Cloud security overview
  * Preparing to install
  * Installing the cluster
  * Securing the kube-apiserver
  * Networking
  * Workload considerations
  * Issue detection
  * And more…



Watch Tim’s video to learn more about this exciting course and how it can help you improve the security of your cloud native applications!
