======

It seems Microsoft is nagging Windows users more frequently to switch to Windows 11. Time to upgrade to Linux? Perhaps. When support for Windows XP and 7 ended, it prompted many people to explore Linux on their personal computer. Will the demise of Windows 10 present the same opportunity?

## 💡 Quick handy tip

On GNOME, (I used GNOME 45 here), you can disable the insertion of a character repeatedly when holding down a key.

In Settings, go to Accessibility > Typing > Type Assist. Here, turn off the repeat key option.

Now, when typing, holding down a character key will only result in the character being placed once.
