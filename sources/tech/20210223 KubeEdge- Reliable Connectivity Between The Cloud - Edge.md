KubeEdge: Reliable Connectivity Between The Cloud & Edge
======

[KubeEdge][1] is an open source project that originated at Huawei and contributed to CNCF. The project is created for extending containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at the edge. It is built on top of Kubernetes and provides infrastructure support for network, application deployment, and metadata synchronization between the cloud and the edge. We sat down with Zefeng Wang (Kevin), Lead of Cloud Native Open Source Team at Huawei, to learn more about the project.
