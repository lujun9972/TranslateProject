FOSS Weekly #24.10: Second Brain Apps, Kernel Programming, New Linux Apps and More
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

Not sure if you have noticed it already, we are doing more Linux book reviews this year. It's a way to introduce you to interesting new Linux books that you may want to explore.

Take Linux Kernel Programming book, for example. It's an excellent resource with hands-on approach to get into kernel development.

I hope you enjoy learning about these books.

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

  * Check out second brain apps.
  * A new project that combines the power of Nix and BSD.
  * New Linux apps that took us by surprise.
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!
  * **This edition of FOSS Weekly is supported by PikaPods.**

### 🧠 What we’re thinking about

I have been seeing a flood of AI-generated articles since last year. It is really concerning to see a such a big name like CNET being caught serving low-quality content to their readers.

### 💡 Quick handy tip

Move a specific window to the currently visible workspace in GNOME.

When using GNOME Apps, you can right-click on an empty space in the title and then select the “ _Always on Visible Workspace_ ” option.

Now, whenever you change to a new workspace, that specific app will be moved to that workspace.
