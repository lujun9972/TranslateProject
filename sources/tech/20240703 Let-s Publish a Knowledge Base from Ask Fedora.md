Let’s Publish a Knowledge Base from Ask Fedora
======

### “We often get questions..”

Just like bug reports or support tickets, a user Q&A support forum is a gold mine for understanding users and contributors.

Newcomers get help from contributors to solve problems in user Q&A support forums like _Ask Fedora_. Some of the solutions work for many situations where users can apply the solutions without modifications. To our surprise, there are repeated questions for similar or related issues every week.

### Content reuse and rewriting

This is where content reuse comes in. The idea is to select top posts in _Ask Fedora_ and consolidate them for How-To and FAQ-style user documentation. Why? Content reuse and rewriting can help make maintenance and enhancement of articles easier than in forum posts. With this in mind, I gave a talk about “Documenting Top Answers in a User Support Forum” at [DevConfCZ][4] in June 2024.

### Call for Participation: Reviewers and Writers

We are looking for anyone interested in this effort to join us.

To kick off this effort I analyzed forum posts by pulling a list of tags that relate to multimedia. Next I grouped them by top answers on multimedia.

[How to debug sound problems][5]
[Audio input not recognized][6]
[Use of multiple Bluetooth device][7]
[PulseAudio and PipeWire troubleshooting][8]

Docs team have [contributor guides][9] for submitting your draft to a Quick Docs repository. If you need help with the process, please stop by at [the Matrix Docs room][10] for more informal communication. Thank you!
