Slimbook Fedora 2: New Ultrabooks for Fedora Linux 40
======

![][1]

The response from the Fedora community to the Fedora Slimbook 16‚Äù and 14‚Äù has been great! More and more people are noticing the quality of these laptops. We‚Äôve even had a demo unit at events like **FOSDEM** and **SCaLE** for community members to play with.

To build on that excitement, Slimbook and the Fedora Project are announcing [**Slimbook Fedora 2**][2]!

### Slimbook Fedora 2

The Slimbook Fedora 2 comes in the 14‚Äù and 16‚Äù models and brings with it fantastic new options.

  * Silver is popular, but how about a **smooth black Magnesium chassis**?
  * For those who need it, you now have the option of a **US ANSI keyboard layout** so you can work without skipping a beat!
  * CPU is being upgraded to **Intel‚Äôs 13th Gen i7** processor
  * Take your work to the next level with the **Nvidia RTX 4000 series** graphics card in the 16‚Äù model



Of course we can‚Äôt forget that the Slimbook Fedora 2 will also come with the Fedora logo engraved on the lid, as well as on the super key. üòâ

This hardware update comes with a software upgrade courtesy of Fedora‚Äôs latest release, **Fedora Workstation 40**. Featuring **GNOME 46** and numerous other enhancements, Slimbook Fedora 2 continues to be a great travel companion. Fedora Linux 40 also comes with the latest **Nouveau** drivers to give you a much better out of the box experience with the Nvidia graphics card in the 16‚Äù model.

Slimbook is dedicated to supporting open source initiatives. As part of that, 3% of the proceeds from each Slimbook Fedora unit sold will continue to be donated to the **GNOME Foundation**.

Besides that there is also the Fedora contributor discount which gives you an additional ‚Ç¨100 off! If you‚Äôre a contributor to the Fedora Project you can find more info on how to get this discount from [this Community Blog post][3].

Additionally, Slimbook offers a ‚Ç¨150 discount for everyone on last year‚Äôs model. You can purchase the previous model with a discount through this link: <https://fedora.slimbook.com>.
