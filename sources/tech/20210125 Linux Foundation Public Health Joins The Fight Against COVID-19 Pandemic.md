Linux Foundation Public Health Joins The Fight Against COVID-19 Pandemic
======

Brian Behlendorf is one of the most respected luminaries of the open-source world. He has been heading the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project since its inception and recently took over additional responsibilities of the [Linux Foundation Public Health][1]. With the new administration sworn in, there will be an increased focus on science-backed public health efforts, and the foundation is best positioned to help the public sector with the strategic availability of open-source technologies to tackle serious health crises. In this interview, we dived deep into the scope of the Linux Foundation Public Health project. It’s going to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and address many other public health issues that we may see due to climate change and so on.
