Deep Dive With Fastfetch; a Neofetch Alternative
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

[Fastfetch][3] is a command-line tool to display detailed information about your system in an easy-to-comprehend format. Remember Neofetch, which used to do this? Unfortunately, [Neofetch is no longer being updated][4].

In any case, you'll find Fastfetch to be a great alternative.

It offers similar features, including a cool ASCII logo of your operating system. Fastfetch provides a lot of information about your system, like CPU, GPU, memory, Local IP, and more. Plus, it's highly customizable, so you can tweak the output to show exactly what you want.

Whether you're a casual user or a tech enthusiast, Fastfetch is a handy tool. Let's see what it can achieve.

### Install Fastfetch on your Linux system

Fastfetch is available in the official repositories of several popular Linux distributions.

If you are an Arch Linux user, install Fastfetch using the pacman command:

```

    sudo pacman -Syu fastfetch

```

Fedora users can install Fastfetch by running the command:

```

    sudo dnf install fastfetch

```

openSUSE users can use the Zypper command:

```

    sudo zypper install fastfetch

```

For Ubuntu, you can install Fastfetch from PPA. First, add the PPA to your system:

```

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zhangsongcui3371/fastfetch

```

Now, update the package cache and install Fastfetch.

```

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install fastfetch

```

### Using Fastfetch

Once you have installed Fastfetch, you can use the `fastfetch` command to run Fastfetch with the default configuration.

```

    fastfetch

```

This will output a big ASCII logo along with a comprehensive list of system information.

![Fastfetch Default][5]

Let's see how you can configure Fastfetch to your personal needs.

#### 1\. Generate a configuration file

The configuration file for Fastfetch is generally located at `~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc`. From the file, it is clear that, the Fastfetch configuration is JSON with comments.

When you install Fastfetch for the first time, you won't get a configuration file. So the first step is to generate a simple config file. For this, run the command:

```

    fastfetch --gen-config

```

![Generate Config][6]

üìã

An editor with JSON Scheme support is recommended for editing the fastfetch config file.

You are good to go now.

#### 2\. Using different logos

The ASCII Logo of the distribution makes these fetch tools more cool to watch. Like Neofetch, Fastfetch can also generate system info with different logos.

First, list all the available logos using the command:

```

    fastfetch --list-logos

```

This will list the proper names of all the available logos.

![List built-in logos][7]

This is a huge list with 400+ entries! Let's say I want to use the Fedora logo in Ubuntu. Here, I will use the `-l` option to specify the name of the logo.

üìã

You can use the `--print-logos` option to print the built-in logo. But, most of the time, you won't see all the results because of the terminal scroll-back buffer limit.

![Ubuntu System, Fedora Logo][8]

#### 3\. Change the color of the logo

#####

To make the logo appear in a different color, you can use the command:

```

    fastfetch --logo-color-[1-9] color

```

Now, the [1-9] is the placeholder. If you have a logo that has multiple colors in it, you can decide which color appear where.

![Custom Color Combination][9]

#### 4\. Set a custom logo (workaround)

Fastfetch can show a custom image in place of the logo displayed.

üöß

This is not properly worked for me. I used both GNOME terminal and Konsole, and custom image was not showing. Anyway, you can get it working as a workaround.

First, make sure you have `jp2a` installed. If not, install using:

```

    sudo apt install jp2a

```

Now, convert the image you want to show as an ASCII logo and save it to a text file.

```

    jp2a imput-image.png > out.txt

```

Now, use this logo for Fastfetch.

```

    fastfetch --logo <path/to/out.txt>

```

That‚Äôs it. Your image will be placed as the logo. If you want to change the color, use:

```

    fastfetch --logo-color-1 cyan --logo <path/to/out.txt>

```

![Custom ASCII Logo and Color][10]

If you have a terminal like [Foot][11], you can display and image using the `sixel`. Run:

```

    fastfetch --logo-type sixel --logo <path/to/file.png> --logo-width 40 --logo-height 15

```

This will display the PNG image in the terminal.

![Fastfetch in Foot Terminal][12]

#### 5\. Dynamically set the structure of Fastfetch

In Fastfetch, you can specify what modules are to be displayed. First, list all the available modules in Fastfetch using the command:

```

    fastfetch --list-modules

```

![List Available Modules][13]

Now, for example, if you want to launch Fastfetch and display only the _OS, Kernel, Packages, Terminal, Memory, and Locale_. Specify these options in a ":" separated form to `-s` option. Like:

```

    fastfetch -s OS:Kernel:Packages:Terminal:Memory:Locale

```

![Print Specified Modules][14]

In the above screenshot, you can see that there is no gap between the command input and the fastfetch output. This is because we didn't ask to print the Separator module.

üí°

The names of the modules listed above are later used inside the config files. So, you can always list all the available modules to get the proper module name.

#### 6\. Use a preset configuration

Not ready to edit the configuration files? Don‚Äôt worry! There are some cool presets available out of the box.

First, list all the available presets using:

```

    fastfetch --list-presets

```

![List built-in presets][15]

Now, you can load a particular preset configuration using the `-c` option.

```

    fastfetch -c neofetch.jsonc

```

The above command will load Fastfetch looking exactly like Neofetch.

![Fastfetch with Neofetch Configuration][16]

There are several presets like _paleofetch.jsonc, hardware.jsonc, etc._ Of which, another cool one is, _**btw.jsonc**_.

![Fastfetch using btw configuration][17]

That is funny. It shows distro name as Arch Linux, pacman as packages, on an Ubuntu system üòâ

#### 7\. Configure using file

As I mentioned earlier, you can fine control Fastfetch using the configuration file. Open Fastfetch config file in a JSON supported IDE. Here, I am [using VS Code][18].

##### Add a default module

As you can see, when you hover over a module name, it reports that a ‚Äúdefault configuration‚Äù is used.

![Run with default configuration][19]

The modules can be used in Fastfetch config by following the format:

```

    "modules": [
        "modname1",
        "modname2",
        "modname3"
    ]

```

In this format, the specified modules will be run in the default values.

##### Modify a module

Now you can run a module with some custom values. The general syntax is:

```

    "modules": [
        {
        "type": "modename1",
        "format": "value",
        "Other": "value"
        }
        {
        "type": "modname2",
        "option": "value",
        "option": "value"
        }
    ]

```

As shown above, we use the module name inside the ‚Äútype‚Äù field. Here comes the use of an IDE like VS Code. Here, as you continue typing, it will suggest the possible values.

Editing the Fastfetch modules in VS Code

In the above video, you can see the suggestions in action.

It is possible to use some modules to run with default configuration and some others with custom configuration.

```

    "module": [
        "modone",
        "modetwo",
        {
        "type": "modethree",
        "option": "value"
        }
        "modfour",
        {
        "type": "modfive",
        "option": "value"
        }
        "modesix"
    ]

```

If you are struggling with the options, you can [take a look at the preset configurations][20] for an understanding.

#### 8\. Get detailed help

The man page of fastfetch only provides a limited help regrading the tool. So for a quick reference, you can read the manual page of Fastfetch.

```

    man fastfetch

```

Apart from the man page, Fastfetch offers a comprehensive help mechanism by using the `--help` option.

```

    fastfetch --help | less

```

![The Fastfetch help mechanism][21]

With the [less command][22], you can scroll the output to view things easily.

To get help for a particular option, you can use:

```

    fastfetch -h <option-name>

```

Here, the `option-name` should not contain the `--` prefix.

For example,

```

    fastfetch -h gen-config

```

will show the details of that option.

![Get help for a particular option][23]

Other than that, to output the format of a module, use the command:

```

    fastfetch -h <module>-format

```

For example:

```

    fastfetch -h os-format

```

### Conclusion

I understand that most Linux users will probably install Fastfetch to display the distro logo in ASCII format.

But there is a minority that wants to do more than the default offering. This tutorial caters to that small group of people who like to go the extra mile.

I hope it helps you utilize the full potential of Fastfetch.
