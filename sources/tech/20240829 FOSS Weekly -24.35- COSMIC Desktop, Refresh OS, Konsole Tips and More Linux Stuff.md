FOSS Weekly #24.35: COSMIC Desktop, Refresh OS, Konsole Tips and More Linux Stuff
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

Is BSD still relevant in the age when Linux dominates the servers? That's a matter of debate.

The reason I brought up BSD is the news that [FreeBSD recently got a funding boost][3] to improve its infrastructure. Relevant or not, it's good to see open source projects getting funding. Am I right?

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition**

  * A new Debian-based Linux distribution.
  * A Windows update breaking dual-booting for many.
  * Proton VPN finally introducing a new protocol for Linux.
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!
  * **This edition of FOSS Weekly is supported by ANY.RUN**
