Linus Torvalds on where Rust will fit into Linux (ZDNet)
======

Rust is popular because it lends itself more easily to writing secure software.

In Linux circles, Alex Gaynor and Geoffrey Thomas at the 2019 Linux Security Summit said that about two-thirds of Linux kernel vulnerabilities come from memory safety issues. Rust, in theory, can completely avoid these by using [Rust’s inherently safer application programmer interfaces (API)s.][2]
