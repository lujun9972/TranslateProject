Do you like short videos and reels? Lately, we have been posting some real cool ones on [our Instagram account][3]. There are lit video memes and interesting bytes of old interviews of computing legends like Torvalds, Stallman, Ritchie, Thompson etc. Take [this video of Ken Thompson discussing][4] how grep was built "overnight" for example.

These videos are being loved by the IG public. We got over 13,000 new followers in the last 30 days itself. If you use Instagram, do join us for the extra infotainment 🤘
