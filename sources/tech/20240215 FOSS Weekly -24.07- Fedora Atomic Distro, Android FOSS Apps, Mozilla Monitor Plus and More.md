FOSS Weekly #24.07: Fedora Atomic Distro, Android FOSS Apps, Mozilla Monitor Plus and More
======

Twitter's open source rival BlueSky is now open for all. It is based on the [AT Protocol][1]. And [It's FOSS is already on this new platform][2]. We got to try new things, right?

Speaking of new things, there is a new Rust-based terminal that is generating quite a buzz in various coding communities on the web. It is called [Warp][3] and it brings IDE-styled editor to the terminal.

It is not open source and it is not available to everyone on Linux yet. However, I have got my hands it and soon I'll be checking if it's really worth all the hype. Afterwards, I'll share my experience with you, hopefully next week. If interested, you can check out its other promised features from its website below.
