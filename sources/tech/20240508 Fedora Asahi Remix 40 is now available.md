We are happy to announce the general availability of Fedora Asahi Remix 40. This release brings the [newly released][2] Fedora Linux 40 to Apple Silicon Macs.

[Fedora Asahi Remix][3] is developed in close collaboration with the [Fedora Asahi SIG][4] and the [Asahi Linux][5] project. It was [unveiled][6] at Flock 2023 and first [released][7] later in December with Fedora Asahi Remix 39.

In addition to all the [exciting improvements][8] brought by Fedora Linux 40, Fedora Asahi Remix brings [conformant OpenGL 4.6][9] support to Apple Silicon. It also continues to provide extensive [device support][10], including high quality audio out of the box.

Fedora Asahi Remix offers [KDE Plasma 6][11] as our flagship desktop experience. It also features a custom Calamares-based initial setup wizard. A GNOME variant is also available, featuring GNOME 46, with both desktop variants matching what Fedora Linux offers. Fedora Asahi Remix also provides a Fedora Server variant for server workloads and other types of headless deployments. Finally, we offer a Minimal image for users that wish to build their own experience from the ground up.

You can install Fedora Asahi Remix today by following our [installation guide][12]. Existing systems, running Fedora Asahi Remix 39, can be updated following the usual Fedora [upgrade process][13].

Please report any Remix-specific issues in our [tracker][14], or reach out in our [Discourse forum][15] or our [Matrix room][16] for user support.
