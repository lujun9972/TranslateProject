New, Free Training Course Explores How to Deploy a Microservice-Based Architecture Using the TARS Project
======

_The Linux Foundation and The TARS Foundation have released a new, free training course, Building Microservice Platforms with TARS, on the edX platform. The course explains how to efficiently develop microservices programs using different programming languages and quickly deploy the corresponding services into applications. It also delves into the powerful functionalities of TARS – a high performance, open source RPC framework developed by Tencent as a full-fledged enterprise solution for microservice maintenance, development and operation – and the components that make up the TARS ecosystem._
