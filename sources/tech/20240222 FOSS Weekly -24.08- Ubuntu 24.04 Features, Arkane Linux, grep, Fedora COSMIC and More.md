FOSS Weekly #24.08: Ubuntu 24.04 Features, Arkane Linux, grep, Fedora COSMIC and More
======

It seems that Fedora is gearing up for more novel variants. Last week, I shared the news about Fedora Atomic spin and now they are considering a COSMIC spin. COSMIC is a new, Rust-based desktop environment by Pop!_OS.

The more, the merrier?

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

  * Arcane Linux brings a unique touch to immutability.
  * A neat to-do app that doesn't get in the way.
  * The beginnings of a COSMIC-flavored Fedora spin.
  * Features that make Ubuntu 24.04 LTS worth the wait.
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!

## 📰 Linux news

  * Mozilla has [laid off][1] staff to focus more on their core offerings.

## 🧠 What we’re thinking about

More indie publishers are realizing that Google is favoring big media publications in the search results. And this threatens the existence of independent websites like It's FOSS.

Bigger publications are using AI generated substandard content on Linux (and other topics) and yet, you'll get to see them first in the search results. **All the more reasons to support your favorite blogs and websites before they are obliterated by the media giants and big tech.**

Here, click on the “ _Add Action_ ” button and inside the “ _Input Here_ ” button, click the additional button on your mouse that you want to use. Now, select the desired action from the dropdown menu and click “ _Apply_ ”.
