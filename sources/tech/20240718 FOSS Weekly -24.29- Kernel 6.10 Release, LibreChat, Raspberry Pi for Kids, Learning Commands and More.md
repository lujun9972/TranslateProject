## 💡 Quick handy tip

In KDE Plasma, the * _klipboard_ * (hah) can actually help you open the contents based on the MIME type. First, open the clipboard by clicking on the clipboard icon in the panel.

Now, click on the _Action_ button located next to the clipboard item and select a suitable app. In the screenshot below, I have a URL copied and can select apps, that can handle HTML document.

![][21]

Similarly, images can be opened using any of the apps installed (like Gwenview), that can handle image files.

## 🤣 Meme of the week

Occasionally, it can be a handful. But, never lose hope newbies!
