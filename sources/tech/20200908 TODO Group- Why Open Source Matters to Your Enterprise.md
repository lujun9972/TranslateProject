TODO Group: Why Open Source Matters to Your Enterprise
======

The TODO Group writes at the Linux Foundation blog:

_While open source software offers many reliable and provable business advantages, sometimes those advantages remain obscure to those who have not looked deeply into the topic, including many high-level decision-makers. This paper, published by the European Chapter of the [TODO Group][1], aims to provide a balanced and quick overview of the business pros and cons of using open source software._
