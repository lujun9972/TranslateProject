FOSS Weekly #24.06: Ollama AI, Zorin OS Upgrade, Damn Small Linux, Sudo on Windows and More
======

I'll open the newsletter with good news.

Damn Small Linux is back from a long slumber, features a new antiX base. It's one of the [smallest Linux distros][1] out there.

This is a special project because back in its earlier version, it was an OS that fit under 50 MB. Yes, you read that right. Even in the new edition, everything will be under 700 MB.

It's a work in development. Hardly an alpha release but good to see the project being resurrected.

So, don't throw that 1 GB RAM laptop yet. It may still be useful to some extent with Damn Small Linux 😄

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

  * Two new office suite releases for Linux.
  * GNOME steps up its documentation game.
  * A neat way to run LLMs locally on Raspberry Pis.
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!
