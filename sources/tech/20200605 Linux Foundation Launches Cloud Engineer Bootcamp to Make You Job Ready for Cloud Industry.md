Linux Foundation Launches Cloud Engineer Bootcamp to Make You Job Ready for Cloud Industry
======

[Linux Foundation][1], the official organization behind Linux project, has launched a [6 months online training program to prepare more cloud engineers][2] as the demand for cloud-skilled people grows in the IT industry.

These days, when the IT infrastructure revolves around cloud computing, _**traditional Linux sysadmin knowledge is not sufficient anymore**_.

Sysadmins need to know the newer technologies related to Linux containers, the backbone of cloud servers.

No one understands the technology trend in this field better than Linux Foundation. They work closely with industry giants like IBM, Microsoft, Google, Cisco to lead, to guide and to set industry standards.

Their latest training module [Cloud Engineer Bootcamp][2] is another step in this regard to bridge the demand and supply in the IT industry.

### Cloud Engineer Bootcamp from The Linux Foundation

The course is designed in a way that you could start learning from scratch. It starts covering the core, traditional knowledge of Linux system administration and then moves on to networking. You may take the certification exam at this point but that’s not mandatory and you can do it later.

The second part of the course module introduces you to containers (heard of Docker?) and then goes on to educate you on DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering). You’ll then learn about Kubernetes, the latest hot topic in the DevOps world.

When you cover the DevOps courses, you can take the certification exam. Linux Foundation certifications are one of the most valued in the industry, and it would help you boost your resume and your job prospect.

  * Week 1-4: [Essentials of Linux System Administration][4] (LFS201)
  * Week 5-9: [Linux Networking and Administration][5] (LFS211)
  * Week 10: [Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator Exam][6] (LFCS)
  * Week 11-14: [Containers Fundamentals][7] (LFS253)
  * Week 15-18: [DevOps and SRE Fundamentals][8] (LFS261)
  * Week 19-23: [Kubernetes Fundamentals][9] (LFS258)
  * Week 24: [Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam][10] (CKA)



Here’s what you’ll get if you join the bootcamp:

  * Hand-on labs and assignments
  * 12 months access to the online courses
  * Dedicated discussion forums to ask for help with **option to live chat with the instructor** (within office hours)
  * Retake for both certification exams within a period of a year
  * 30 days money back guarantee



The course is self-paced and you should cover it in 6 months with an effort of 15-20 hours a week.

Cloud Engineer Bootcamp is priced at $999 but **if you join before 17th June, you can get it for $599 (saves you $400)**. Individually, these courses and exams will cost you around $2000.

### Should you sign up for the Cloud Engineer Bootcamp?

Frankly, this could not have come at a better time. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, economy is in poor state. People are losing jobs everywhere.

But the pandemic has also given boost to remote working and cloud computing business. As more companies prepare to adopt remote working, cloud servers will be more in demand.

It is high time to improve or learn skills that are sought after in the industry.

$600 may not be a small amount but considering that it can lend you a new job or promotion at your current work, [Cloud Engineer Bootcamp][2] is worth the investment.

If you don’t like the training or think it’s not worth the money, you can use the 30-day money back guarantee and get your money back. It cannot be safer than this.

Though Linux Foundation hardly makes any effort for “desktop Linux”, they are constantly working to promote Linux in the IT industry. Their training and certification programs are part of their effort to make more and more people job ready.
