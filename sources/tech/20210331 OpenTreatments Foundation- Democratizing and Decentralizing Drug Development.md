OpenTreatments Foundation: Democratizing and Decentralizing Drug Development
======

Sanath Kumar Ramesh is the Founder &amp; CEO of the [OpenTreatments Foundation][1], which [was announced today at the Linux Foundation][2]. Ramesh created the foundation as he looked at medical solutions to help his son suffering from an ultra-rare genetic disease called SSMD ([curegpx4.org][3]). He is building the world’s first software platform to decentralize drug development and empower anyone in the world to create treatments for genetic diseases.
