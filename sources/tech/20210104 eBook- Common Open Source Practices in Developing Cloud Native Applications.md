With the advent of digital transformation, enterprises are facing more difficult business realities.  As cloud computing has continued to grow, Cloud-Native applications have become a critical driving force for business innovation. Migrating to the cloud-native model can help businesses boost their productivity and increase competitiveness in the market. 

Cloud-Native technologies take advantage of different environments such as public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud to build and run scalable applications that are easy to manage and monitor. Through Cloud-Native technologies, enterprises can enable faster software delivery cycles and drastically improve applications’ agility, elasticity, and availability. 

In this eBook, you will find information about popular open source technologies used in different areas of Cloud-Native applications, such as containers, container orchestration, and microservices. We will highlight the most notable and relevant open source projects, including Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, the Kubernetes native solution for TARS services, to help you gain a quick understanding of Cloud-Native tools available these days.
