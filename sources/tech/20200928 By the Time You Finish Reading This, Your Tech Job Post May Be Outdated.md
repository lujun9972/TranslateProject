By the Time You Finish Reading This, Your Tech Job Post May Be Outdated
======

_As the rate of technological advancement and change continues to accelerate, new tools are being developed and released at such a swift pace that no individual tech professional can stay on top of them all. Consequently, this leads to talent gaps that can delay digital transformation. For example, a recent study found that “only 23% of organizations believe they have the talent required to successfully complete their cloud native journey.”_

_But how do you outline skill and experience requirements for technology that is evolving so rapidly?_
