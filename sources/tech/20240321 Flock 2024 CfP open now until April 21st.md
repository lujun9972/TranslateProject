Apply now for the Flock to Fedora 2024 Call for Proposals (CfP) at [cfp.fedoraproject.org][2]. This year, Flock is using Pretalx as our CfP system. If you submitted a proposal to DevConf CZ this year, it will feel familiar. **The submission deadline for the Flock 2024 CfP is Sunday, April 21st, 2024**.

For more details on what the Flock 2024 CfP reviews are looking for this year, read the full announcement **[on the Fedora Community Blog][3]**. You can also read the [original Flock 2024 announcement][4] on the Fedora Magazine.
