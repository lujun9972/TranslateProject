Contribute at the Fedora Linux 37 Test Week for Kernel 5.18 
======

![][1]

The kernel team is working on final integration for Linux kernel 5.18. This version was just recently released, and will arrive soon in Fedora. As a result, the Fedora kernel and QA teams have organized a test week now through **Sunday, June 12, 2022.** Refer to the [wiki][2] [page][2] for links to the test images you’ll need to participate. Read below for details.

### How does a test week work?

A test week is an event where anyone can help make sure changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members often participate, and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed before, this is a perfect way to get started.

To contribute, you only need to be able to do the following things:

  * Download test materials, which include some large files
  * Read and follow directions step by step



The [wiki page][2] for the kernel test day has a lot of good information on what and how to test. After you’ve done some testing, you can log your results in the test day [web][3] [application][3]. If you’re available on or around the day of the event, please do some testing and report your results. We have a document which provides [all the steps][4] written.

Happy testing, and we hope to see you on test day.
