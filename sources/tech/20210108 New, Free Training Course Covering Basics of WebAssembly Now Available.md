New, Free Training Course Covering Basics of WebAssembly Now Available
======

[Introduction to WebAssembly][1] is the newest training course from The Linux Foundation! This course, offered on the non-profit edX learning platform, can be audited by anyone at no cost.

It is also language-agnostic, being a suitable compilation target for a wide range of modern languages.
