## 💡 Quick Handy Tip

On GNOME Files (Nautilus), you can show additional details for each folder in _Icon_ view. First, go to _**Menu**_ ➝ _**Preferences**_.

Here, scroll down and set the three levels of details from the corresponding drop-down menus.

Now, when you zoom the icon view to a particular level, you can view all of those selected details. You can also choose to go for showing only one or two additional details.
