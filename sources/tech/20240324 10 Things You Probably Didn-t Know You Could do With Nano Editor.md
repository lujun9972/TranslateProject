10 Things You Probably Didn't Know You Could do With Nano Editor
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

There are [numerous terminal based text editors available on Linux][3]. Vim has a special fan following for its extensive expendability. It can be used as a full-blown code editor, after all.

Nano is often considered a beginner's tool but it is also a feature-rich editor. Most users are not even aware of its full capability.

In this tutorial, I am going to list a few lesser known features that may help you get an even better editing experience with Nano.

Sounds interesting? Here, we go.

### 1\. Using mouse inside nano

Like most editors in the command line, the mouse has no particular role in Nano too.

But that doesn't mean you cannot use mouse at all in Nano. A little bit of mouse support would come handy at times, specially for beginners.

To enable basic mouse functions in nano, use:

```

    nano -m <filename>

```

It will let you :

  1. Place the cursor on a position by left-clicking on that position.
  2. Mark text by holding Shift and drag with left click.

### 2\. Displaying a scrollbar

Actually, this is not a usual scrollbar where you can click and drag to scroll. This is more like a viewport. Setting this viewport/scrollbar on the right-hand side of the editor will help you identify at which part of the document you are currently scrolling through.

Enable the scrollbar in Nano by opening a file with the `-q` option.

```

    nano -q <filename>

```

![Show scrollbar][4]

Yeah! `q` is not quiet mode here üòâ

### 3\. Showing line numbers

It is helpful at times to see which line you are at in the text files.

To show the line numbers, you can open a file using the `l` or `--linenumbers` option.

```

    nano -l <filename>

```

![Show line numbers][5]

If you have already opened a file and want to toggle the line numbers, you can use the key **Meta + N**. Meta key is usually the left Alt key on most systems.

![Toggle Line numbers within Nano][6]

üí°

The meta key in Nano is usually the left Alt key on most systems.

### 4\. Placing a minibar

Instead of placing a status bar on the bottom and a title bar on the top, you can combine both functions and place a simple minibar on the bottom.

To do that, open the file with the command:

```

    nano --minibar <filename>

```

![Minibar in Nano][7]

This will show:

  * File name (with an asterisk, if there are any unsaved modifications).
  * When first opened, it shows the number of lines in the file. This disappears if you press any key.



While you are in this view, you can press **Meta + C** to get some more details like, current cursor position, how deep you are in the document (in percentage, based on the line), etc.

### 5\. Going distraction free

Nano, by default, comes with a title bar at the top, a status bar at the bottom, along with some help commands on the bottom. Some time, you may want to get a distraction-free environment. In this case, open the file using:

```

    nano -0 <filename>

```

This will hide the title bar, status bar and the help section. Any important message will appear on the bottom status bar part, and will disappear in 1.5 seconds after pressing any key.

![Distraction-free mode][8]

If you are within a file and want to hide parts of the editor, you can use:

  1. **Meta + Z** : Toggle Title and Status bar.
  2. **Meta + X** : Toggle the Help section at the bottom.



### 6\. Automatically saving file at exit

To save a file in nano, you will use **CTRL + O**. At the same time, you can use **CTRL + X** and then save by pressing y, and then press enter, to actually [save and exit nano][9].

If you find this process uneasy, nano has an autosave option!

You need to open the file, you want to autosave upon exit, using the `-t` option.

```

    nano -t <filename>

```

Now, when editing is done, use **CTRL + X** to exit. It will be automatically saved, and you will not get any prompt, asking to save file, confirm exit, etc.

![Autosave on exit][10]

### 7\. Automatically saving a backup version

Nano allows you to save a version of the file as a backup with the `-B` option. What this does is, save the previous, unmodified version (the version before editing) with a new file name. The new file name is the existing file name with an `~` character appended to the end.

The new backup file will be saved in the same directory as the current file.

```

    nano -B <filename>

```

![Save a backup version][11]

### 8\. Checking spelling

To make spell check possible and efficient, you must install the `hunspell` package first.
To install `hunspell` on Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems, use the command:

```

    sudo apt install hunspell

```

You may need to verify that the language has properly installed. For this, go to **System Settings ‚Üí Region and Language**. Here, click on the **Manage Installed Languages** button.

![Click on the Manage Installed Languages button][12]

It will report if any installations needed. Install the required packages by clicking on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button.

![Install language packages properly][13]

Now, you can open a text file using the command:

```

    nano -s hunspell <filename>

```

Once opened, press **CTRL + T** and then **CTRL + S**. This will start checking the spelling of the current text. You can notice that, it has started marking the wrongly spelled words. Also, it gives some suggestions for you.

![Spell check in Nano][14]

You can press the number given adjacent to the suggested word to use that word in place of the wrongly spelled one. Once all the spelling errors are cleared, save the file and exit nano.

üöß

It works better for en_US dictionary files. If you are using some other system default locale, you may encounter some errors with hunspell. I have faced some errors with the dictionary files en_IN. If you encounter this, the simple solution is to [reconfigure the system language to en_US][15].

### 9\. Placing cursor at a specified position

While opening a file in nano, you can specify where to place the cursor inside that file.

```

    nano +c/Foo <filename>

```

This will open the file with the cursor at the first occurrence of the word Foo. Let's see what does the options mean.

  * **+** : Search for the specified word from the beginning of the text. Use **-** instead, to start searching for the word from the end of the file.
  * **c** : Small letter **c** indicates a case-sensitive search.



![Place cursor on specified location][16]

### 10\. Opening file in read-only mode

Nano also supports a view-only mode, where, you cannot enter any characters. You can only view the file.

I know that most people use commands like `less` for this purpose, but if you are someone who uses one tool for multiple purposes, this will be a good addition.

To open a file in view mode, use:

```

    nano -v <filename>

```

![View-only mode][17]

This will prevent any accidental change to the document.

### Learned something new?

These are some of the unusual and less known features [Nano][18] offers. I hope you learned some new Nano tricks. If you find your new favorite Nano tweak, which one is it? Also, do you know any more such cool Nano features? Share with us in the comments.
