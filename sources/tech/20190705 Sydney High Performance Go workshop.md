Sydney High Performance Go workshop
======

On the 17th of July I’ll be giving a version of my [High Performance Go workshop][1] updated for the upcoming changes in Go 1.13. The event is free, as in puppy, however numbers are limited due to the venue size. The event will be held in the Sydney CBD, the address will be provided to registered attendees closer to the date.

You can find a [link to the workshop description and syllabus here][1].

You can find a [link to the registration page here][2].

### No show policy

If you register for the event then don’t show up you are be depriving someone else of the opportunity to participate. You can cancel you registration at any time up to 23:59 on the 16th. **If you are a no show you will be expected to make a _meaningful_ donation to a charity of my choosing.**
