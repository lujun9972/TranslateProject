FOSS Weekly #24.13: Fedora 40 Features, Lingmo OS, Nano Editor Tips and More
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

It's FOSS has around 2000 articles and it is difficult to find the interesting ones just from browsing the website.

This is what prompted me to consolidate articles based on topics. So, you get pages like [Fedora guides][3], [Rust series][4] etc. I am also putting up 'collection pages' that could let you access a particular topic more easily. The Linux application suggestion collection is one of the many more to be published in the coming weeks.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 FOSSverse corner

I always considered It's FOSS to be focused on desktop Linux users but it was overwhelming to get this message from Martin Nyagah, a reader based in Kenya.

> I recently landed a DevOps job with a digital health platform! I am writing to express my gratitude for the resources you have shared with me. Your help was instrumental in my job search and I truly appreciate it.I am looking forward to continuing to learn from you in the future.

Got something interesting to say? You may share your views through [this form][18] and I'll feature them on the upcoming It's FOSS testimonials page.
