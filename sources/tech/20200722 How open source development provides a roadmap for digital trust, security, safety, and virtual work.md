How open source development provides a roadmap for digital trust, security, safety, and virtual work
======

Mike Dolan writes on the Linux Foundation blog:

*We’re seeing a shift to virtual events, remote work cultures, virtual “happy hours,” and other means of productively working together, virtually. Many of these practices will stick with us post-pandemic. Our organization is already exploring how to use [virtual events][1] to augment future physical events (yes, they will exist again). *

_Virtual conferences may be a great path to offering more inclusive events where those of us unable to travel to an event physically can still find a way to participate at some level. We’re seeing the impact of [virtual training and certifying][2] professionals in freely available open source technologies — and it has a real impact on job prospects and employment. Virtual testing proctors have become an effective way to certify professionals. Similarly, virtual platforms can [help facilitate mentorship][3] and enable less experienced developers to find and connect with more skilled developers willing to lend a hand._

*The coronavirus has opened the world’s eyes to the needs of systems and plans for pandemic situations. This year we will likely see technology communities and organizations adapt and develop the “playbook” for how the world does business in the face of a pandemic. But many of those practices will likely stay with us long after we defeat COVID-19. *
