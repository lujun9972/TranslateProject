Fedora Project at FOSDEM 2023
======

Fedora Project will be present at FOSDEM 2023. This article describes this gathering and a few of the events on the agenda. I assume if you are reading the [Fedora Magazine,][2] you already know what FOSDEM is, but I’ll start with a small intro anyway.

### Define FOSDEM

[FOSDEM][3] is the biggest event in the known universe for free/libre and open-source developers and enthusiasts.

Many good people from around the world meet and discuss common topics and define the future of F/LOSS. The event is held in Brussels at the beginning of February. Some of us, who are coming from a bit warmer countries, are calling it _FrOSDEM,_ because it’s usually freezing 🙂

### **Why attend?**

If you are a contributor already or you want to start doing good with your skills for the F/LOSS universe, this event is a must. 

I know everyone has their reason for visiting, but I’ll share the most common ones:

  * You meet the people creating and supporting the products that power the Internet that you already use.
  * If you are a contributor already, you have a chance to meet with your team and people using your product.
  * You learn so much new stuff quickly.
  * You enlarge your horizons by looking at something outside your bubble. If you are a fan of Fedora, go and learn more about [Security or Javascript][4].
  * You have a chance to talk to others with the same passion as yours and even become friends for life. A good friend is always a commodity!
  * You achieve your daily steps goal because the[ ULB campus is enormous][5], and you will have to move a lot to get to the room you would like to visit.
  * You have a chance to [volunteer and help the community][6] if this is what drives you.
  * You attend an event with a great [Code of Conduct.][7]



### **Fedora at FOSDEM 2023**

It’s a tradition for the Fedora Project team to be there to present some of our work from the last year and to allow you to share your feedback on what we do well and how we can improve.

#### **Meet, greet, and see our community in action**

One of the most extraordinary things at FOSDEM, which I deliberately didn’t mention in the previous section, is the [project booths][8]. In almost every building, you will see people behind a branded table, ready to talk to you about their project, its values, and its mission.

 I have to mention the goodies here, as well. You will return home with many items from your favorite projects. Be sure to continue supporting them further.  

We at Fedora will be happy to welcome you to our booth as well. You can talk to the community members, give us constructive feedback, and see some of the things we prepared.

Our booth location is in **building H, **alongside the rest of the Linux Distros.

![Building H, ULB Campus.][10]

Stop by and say _hi_ in your language! We are looking forward to talking to you!

#### **We want to share what makes our work exceptional**

At each FOSDEM we have a good number of talks related to what we do at Fedora. I am listing only some of them to make it enjoyable for you to browse the [agenda][4] and discover the rest yourself.

##### 1: Fedora CoreOS – Your Next Multiplayer Homelab Distro

_Using Fedora CoreOS in a Selfhosted Homelab to setup a Multiplayer Server_

###### **Speakers**

**Akashdeep Dhar**

 Software Engineer, Red Hat Community Platform Engineering

**Sumantro Mukherjee**
 Elected Representative, Fedora Council
 Software Quality Engineer, Red Hat

**Intro**

[Fedora CoreOS][11] is an essential, monolithic, automatically updating operating system optimized for running containers. It focuses on offering the best container host for executing containerized workloads securely and at scale. We will show a [case study of setting up Fedora CoreOS][12] as a self-hosted Homelab distribution for globally accessible (using secure network tunneling) multiplayer servers for video games (namely **Minecraft, Valheim**, etc.).

**When and Where**

Saturday, Feb-4 at the[ Containers devroom][13] from [11:30 to 12:00][14]

Designer at Red Hat’s Community Design Team. 

**Jess Chitas **

**Intro**

The Creative Freedom Summit is a virtual event focused on promoting Open Source tools, spreading knowledge of how to use them, and connecting creatives across the FOSS ecosystem. The summit’s accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the event’s first year and potential changes for the following years.

##### **When and Where**

Sunday, Feb-5 at the[ ][13][Open Source Design Dev Room][15] from [14:30 to 14:55][16]

* * *

#### Where to find more related talks?

Our [wiki page][17] is a good start, but [FOSDEM’s schedule catalog][4] is even better. One life hack: select a good 30 min slot, go through all the rooms which might get your attention, and create a personal schedule in your favorite calendar app. Make sure you have a backup plan because some rooms might be fully occupied, and you cannot enter.

#### **I want to interest you in a challenge**

If you know more than I do about FOSDEM 2023 and have already prepared your schedule, share a single paragraph comment about your FOSDEM plan and list a few of your favorite talks. You will help the community understand the greatness of the event and find more reasons to make the trip to frosty Brussels.

**See you there!**
