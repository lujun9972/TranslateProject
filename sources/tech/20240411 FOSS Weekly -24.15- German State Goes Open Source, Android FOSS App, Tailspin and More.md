## 🗓️ Tech Trivia

The popular version control system Git was released 19 years ago on 7th April 2005. It was created by none other than Linus Torvalds. He was frustrated because the proprietary source control system BitKeeper revoked the free license for Linux kernel development.

Interesting, isn't it? Torvalds created Linux because he could not afford to purchase UNIX and then he created Git in a somewhat similar situation. That's why he is a legend.
