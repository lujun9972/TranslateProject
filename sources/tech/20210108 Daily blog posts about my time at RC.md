Daily blog posts about my time at RC
======

A quick note: I’ve been writing some daily-ish blog posts about what I’ve been doing in my time at the Recurse Center, but I took them out of this RSS feed because I think they’re a bit more stream of consciousness than my usual posts. Here’s where to find them if you’re interested:

  * You can find them all in the [Recurse Center 2020][1] category
  * If you want to subscribe to my daily RC posts, here’s an [RSS link][2]
