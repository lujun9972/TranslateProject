## 💡 Quick handy tip

In the Linux terminal ( _GNOME_ ), you can set a custom command to a separate profile so that it is easy to access.

Let's say you want a separate profile for ZSH sessions. First, find the executable for the command using the _which_ command:

```

    which zsh
    which htop

```

Now, go to GNOME terminal preferences and add a new profile using the “ _+_ ” button. In the “ _Command_ ” section, enable the “ _Run a custom command…_ ” checkbox and in the “ _custom command_ ” field, enter the command location:

![][24]

Now, when required, you can get that profile. 👇

![][25]

In the case of new shells, you can make a new profile for a shell so that there is no need to change your default shell!

If you are making profiles for commands that run and exit, you might want to set the “ _When command exits_ ” option to “ _Hold the terminal open_ ”. Otherwise, when the command completes execution, the window will be closed.

This is ideal for active commands like top and htop.

[Syncom 2][27] launched by NASA as the world's first geosynchronous satellite on July 26, 1963. It was tested for voice, teletype, and facsimile, with a live two-way call between heads of government via satellite showing off its capabilities.
