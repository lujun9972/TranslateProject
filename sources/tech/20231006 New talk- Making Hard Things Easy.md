New talk: Making Hard Things Easy
======

A few weeks ago I gave a keynote at [Strange Loop][1] called Making Hard Things Easy. It’s about why I think some things are hard to learn and ideas for how we can make them easier.

Here’s the video, as well as the slides and a transcript of (roughly) what I said in the talk.
