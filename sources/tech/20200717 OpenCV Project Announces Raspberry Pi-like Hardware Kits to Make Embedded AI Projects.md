OpenCV Project Announces Raspberry Pi-like Hardware Kits to Make Embedded AI Projects
======

In the vast field of artificial intelligence, [computer vision][1] and image recognition is perhaps what most people take interest in.

![Computer Vision is how the machine analyzes the images and videos][2]

If you are interested in this field, you must have heard of OpenCV. [OpenCV][3] is a popular open source project aimed at real-time computer vision.

The OpenCV project has announced its hardware project: [OpenCV Artificial Intelligenc][4][e][4] [Kit][4] (OAK). It is basically a Raspberry Pi like single board computer specially focused on Computer Vision. This project is running a Kickstarter funding campaign.

If you’re someone already working on computer vision, you may have heard of [Nvidia Jetson Nano developer kit][5] as one of the [Raspberry Pi alternatives][6] tailored for AI projects.

Even though Jetson Nano could be a better option for AI projects, it looks like OpenCV AI kit actually makes it easy to get started with building projects with OpenCV out of the box.

Let’s take a look at some details.

### OpenCV AI Kit Overview

![Oak And Oak D Size Comparison with a coin][7]

OpenCV AI Kit (OAK) is an **MIT-licensed open source software** and **[Myriad X][8]-based hardware solution** for computer vision by [OpenCV][9] (if that wasn’t obvious).

You can train your own neural networks or just get started with tracking and detecting things using the existing neural networks that include mask/no-mask detection, age recognition, face detection, object detection, vehicle detection, and more.

Not to forget, you can always use [OpenVINO][10] to deploy your own model using any available dataset.

You will find two variants of the kit — **OAK-1 and OAK-D**.

The OAK-1 includes a **4K AI camera module** and the OAK-D features a **three-camera setup**, both leveraging the **[stereo depth][12] sensor**.

OAK-1 and OAK-D supports **Linux, Windows, and macOS** as hosts.

Even though the OAK API software lets you do a lot of things, there are some board-specific features for OAK-1 and OAK-D that you can find on their [Kickstarter campaign page][13].

As an overview, the official announcement sums up what the OpenCV AI Kit is made up of:

  * **A single-camera 4k @ 60fps hardware module** which includes a Myriad X and is a tiny 45 mm x 30 mm.
  * **A module with a 4k @ 60fps camera and stereo depth cameras** which provide spatial 3D tracking capability. It is about the size of a Raspberry Pi.
  * **A nsoftware library** for advanced on-device real-time neural network processing for the OAK boards.
  * Both boards can run Deep Learning models for image classification, object detection, segmentation, human pose estimation, and many more in real time even on low-power hosts like the Raspberry Pi.



### OpenCV AI Kit Pricing &amp; Availability

For now, you can’t get your hands on it without being a backer on [Kickstarter][13].

But, it’s good to see that the funding goal of **$20,000** was completed in about 20 minutes of launching the campaign or so as they claim.

However, you might want to join in as a backer on Kickstarter because the retail pricing of the AI kit will be twice as what you see right now.

The OAK-1 is priced at **$99** and the OAK-D is available for **$149**, which was just **$79 and $129** for early bird backers.

After the Kickstarter campaign ends, you may notice a retail price of **$199 and $299 respectively**.

Looking at other Myriad-X based options, OpenCV AI Kit looks a lot more promising, cheaper, and easy to get started.

And, considering that they’re a company you can vouch for — it might be a good time to become a backer if you want to get your hands on it.

### Wrapping Up

Looking at the pricing and the feature list, it’s definitely a unique offering to what already exists out there.

What do you think about it? Let me know your thoughts on the same.
