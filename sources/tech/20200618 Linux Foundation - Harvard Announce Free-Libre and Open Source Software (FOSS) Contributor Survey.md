Linux Foundation & Harvard Announce Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FOSS) Contributor Survey
======

The Linux Foundation and Harvard University have announced their new FOSS Contributor Survey:

_“In 2020, given the wide proliferation of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FOSS), we aim to identify how to improve security, including the sustainability of the FOSS ecosystem, especially the FOSS systems heavily relied upon by organizations worldwide._

_To do this, the Linux Foundation’s [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)][1] and the [Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH)][2] have developed a survey for contributors to FOSS. If you contribute to FOSS, we would love for you to participate in our study. This voluntary survey takes around 15-20 minutes to complete and allows you to advocate for the FOSS projects you care about.”_
