13 Open-Source Google Chrome Extensions I Love and Recommend
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

With over 60% of all browser market share, Google Chrome has continued to be the most widely preferred browser worldwide for more than a decade.

I am guessing, if you are here, you use Chrome browser as your daily driver or a secondary browser at best.

While the reasons for its success are many, one of them is the wide range of selections you get in extensions. I can understand if you would rather not ditch Google Chrome just yet, but you can opt for open-source extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

To save you some time, here, I list some of the best and most useful open-source Chrome extensions.

📋

You can install these extensions on any Chromium-based web browsers like Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge, and others.

### 1\. Dark Reader

With a global increase in average screen time, it is essential for you to take care of your eyes. One way to do that is to get [Dark Reader extension][4] on Chrome. It is also one of the best [open-source add-ons for Firefox][5].

Dark Reader flips color contrasts, making brighter colors darker and darker ones, lighter. This, in turn, results in a night mode for every website you visit. You can tweak the look manually as well.

This extra eye protection can go a long way with the amount of eye strenuous work most people engage themselves in.

### 3\. DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials

![][10]

DuckDuckGo (DDG) is one of the [most privacy-friendly search engine][11] out there.

Interestingly, it loves offering open-source apps, just like its [**DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials** extension][12]. It is one of the best open-source browser extensions out there.

With the extension, you get rid of all kinds of third-party trackers and block ads. Furthermore, it forces sites to use an encrypted connection to make sure your data remains safe. Moreover, it helps with email protection, by providing free email aliases.

Well, the [Hypothesis][25] extension does just that. If you are reading an online document or a web page, you cannot annotate everything and collaborate with other users.

It blocks ads, stops trackers, and overall helps your browser experience, a lot smoother. With over 2M users worldwide, it is an actively maintained open-source extension.

### 9\. uBlock Origin Lite

![][33]

uBlock Origin is a popular web extension to block trackers and scripts on web pages. It is an incredibly powerful add-on to any web browser. Unfortunately, it is going away with Chrome's new Manifest v3.

So, if you are on the latest Chrome version, and the legacy extension has stopped working (or shows a warning), you can install [uBlock Origin Lite][34].

It's the same developer with fewer features.

### 10\. Passbolt

![][36]

Writing all your passwords down in an unencrypted note application can often be dangerous. Whether you are an individual or have a team to manage, it is risky. So why not store them in a trusted collaborative password manager instead?

[Passbolt][37] is an open-source password manager for teams. Although, it does not just help with passwords, as you can also easily share a folder with a group of users. You can check out its source code on [GitHub][38].

It can be used to monitor and generate random strong passwords for your team, making sure that all of your data stays safe from all the leaks that keep happening.

No need to scavenge through YouTube or Google anymore, as with daily.dev, every time you open a new tab, you are greeted with developer-centric content. It can be your one-stop option to keep up with everything you like without putting together your feed, saving you time!

### 13\. Requestly
