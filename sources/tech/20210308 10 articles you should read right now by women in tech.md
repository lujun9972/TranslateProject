10 articles you should read right now by women in tech
======
From Kubernetes to Linux, women share their expertise in tech.
![Diversity team meeting][1]

"Women in tech" is a label we use to describe humans who identify as women who are working in or playing with "tech," which is a broad term itself these days as it's all around us, touching almost everyone's life in a myriad of ways.

Some women in tech work in professional roles for software companies and others work in healthcare, education, or astrophysics using technology to get their work done and often interact with the public in some way. While others are coders, hardware nerds, and technical hobbyists by night... or simply, outside of work whether in organized groups and clubs, sharing ideas online with friends, or figuring things out alone.

"Women in tech" might have been a smaller, more niche group of people when it first came into use, but today, it encompasses a much larger group of people... and for that, we're grateful. 

Our [Correspondents program][2] includes a growing group of women, writing on topics ranging from [Kubernetes][3] to what it means [to be "non-technical" in a technical world.][4]

Today, as we celebrate growing diversity in tech, take a moment to read an article from [our list][5] of women writers on the site. And, if you are someone or know someone who might like to share their story or expertise with us, check out [our guide][6] that should have what you need to get started. If you'd like to ask a question or chat with us further, email us at [open@opensource.com][7].
