FOSS Weekly #24.17: All About Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Fedora 40 Releases
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

The two big releases of the year are here; Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Fedora 40. I deferred sending the newsletter by a day so that I could provide you with all the coverage.

Although, [Ubuntu 24.04 comes with several new features][3] and changes, I am unhappy with a change they introduced. I shared my frustration in this article.

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition:**

  * Ubuntu 24.04 and Fedora 40 articles
  * Gentoo saying no to AI generated code.
  * FOSSers discussing who invented Wi-Fi.
  * A neat open-source RSS reader app for Android.
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!



* * *

## 📰 Linux news

  * Gentoo has [banned][5] AI-generated code submissions.
  * Thunderbird [embraces][6] Microsoft Exchange by relying on Rust.
  * [Nextcloud Hub 8][7] has arrived, with AI powering many cool features.



* * *

## 🌱 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

Noble Numbat makes the entry.

And we have covered the release of various official flavors, too:

  * [Lubuntu 24.04 release and features][8]
  * [Ubuntu Budgie 24.04 release and features][9]
  * [Ubuntu Studio 24.04 release and features][10]



If you discard my earlier rant, it's a decent new release.

Learn all about upgrading to 24.04 from earlier Ubuntu versions.

We are also working on 'things to do after installing Ubuntu 24.04' article and Ubuntu 24.04 installation video. Stay tuned for that.

* * *

## 🌷 Fedora 40

Red Hat's community offering Fedora released version 40. Inclusion of PyTorch is a nice touch, specially for students learning AI development.

Here are the steps to upgrade from Fedora 39 to 40.

![][11]

And a few recommendations for setting it up.

## 🧠 What we’re thinking about

Print magazines seem to be a relic of the past. There used to be several dedicated Linux magazines in the late 90s and early 2000s. Linux Voice, Linux Journal are some of the names I can recall.

Surprisingly, there are still a couple of Linux magazines that remain in print even in 2024. Pleasant surprise, actually. Linux Magazine is one of those rare few. Do check it out if you still prefer keeping books in your hand rather than on your screen.

## 🛍️ Exciting offer

Looking for plenty of encrypted cloud storage? Internxt's lifetime deal could be of interest. By **using ITSFOSS80 coupon at checkout** , you can get 2 TB of storage for a single payment of €100.

## 📹 What we are watching

More than watching, we are showing the newness of Ubuntu 24.04. There should be some more videos around it in the coming days.

* * *

## ✨ Project highlights

Is this the only RSS feed reader one might [ever need][14] for their Android smartphone? Read on to find out:

![][4]

Or, how about a tool that lets you censor out sensitive information from images?

![][4]

* * *

## 🧩 New quiz

How familiar are you with Richard Stallman? Can you beat this quiz?

![][11]

## 💡 Quick handy tip

Remove duplicate lines in a file and then sort it using the Gedit text editor.

With the file open, first click on the menu button and then select _Tools ➝ Sort_. On the small dialog box, check the “Remove duplicates” box and then click on _Sort_.

![][15]

You can see the duplicate lines are removed, and the file is sorted. Save to make the changes permanent, or use _CTRL + Z_ to undo the change.

* * *

## 🤣 Meme of the week

Even though I have a few workstations with Arch and NixOS installed, Ubuntu is the one I always rely on to get work done.

![][16]

* * *

## 🗓️ Tech Trivia

On April 23, 2005, the first-ever YouTube video "[Me at the zoo][17]" was uploaded by its founder Jawed. Just one and a half years later, Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion.

* * *

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 FOSSverse corner

FOSSers are [discussing][18] who invented Wi-Fi. Add your insights on this topic, if you have any!
