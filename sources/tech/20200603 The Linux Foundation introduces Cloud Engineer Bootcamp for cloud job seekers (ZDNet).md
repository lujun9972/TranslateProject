The Linux Foundation introduces Cloud Engineer Bootcamp for cloud job seekers (ZDNet)
======

Steven J. Vaughn Nichols writes at ZDNet about the Linux Foundation’s new [Cloud Engineer Bootcamp:][1]

_While there are [plenty of cloud classes][2] out there, the Linux Foundation claims it’s the “first-ever bootcamp program, designed to take individuals from newbie to certified cloud engineer in six months.”_

_The Bootcamp bundles self-paced eLearning courses with certification exams and dedicated instructor support for a comprehensive and well-rounded educational program. As you would imagine for a Bootcamp from the Linux Foundation it starts with Linux at the operating system layer. Since even [Azure is now predominantly Linux][3], this actually makes good sense. From Linux, it moves up the stack, covering DevOps, cloud, containers, and [Kubernetes][4]._

_Specifically, it comprises the following classes and exams:_

  *     * [Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201)][5]
    * [Linux Networking and Administration (LFS211)][6]
    * [Containers Fundamentals (LFS253)][7]
    * [DevOps and SRE Fundamentals: Implementing Continuous Delivery (LFS261)][8]
    * [Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258)][9]
    * [Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator Exam (LFCS)][10]
    * [Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam (CKA)][11]



_Besides the classes, students will also have access to an online forum with other students and instructors. There will also be live virtual office hours with course instructors five days per week. If you enroll, you can expect to spend 15 hours to 20 hours per week on the materials to complete the Bootcamp in about six months. Upon completion, participants will receive LFCS and CKA certification badges and a badge for completing the entire Bootcamp. Badges can be independently verified by potential employers at any time._
