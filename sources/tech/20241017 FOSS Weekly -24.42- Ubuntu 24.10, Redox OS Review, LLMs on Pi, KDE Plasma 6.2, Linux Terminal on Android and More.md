FOSS Weekly #24.42: Ubuntu 24.10, Redox OS Review, LLMs on Pi, KDE Plasma 6.2, Linux Terminal on Android and More
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

Ubuntu 24.10 is available now. This is an interim release and it will be supported till July 2025. If you are on 24.04 LTS, you may stick to it unless you want the shiny new GNOME 47 features.

Fedora 41 should also arrive by the end of the month.

## ❇️PikaPods: Self-hosting Without Hassle

[PikaPods][4] allows you to quickly deploy your [favorite open source software][5]. All future updates are handled automatically by PikaPods while you enjoy using the software. I use it to self-host Umami analytics. Did I tell you that **they also share revenue with the original developers of the software**?

Oh! You also get a $5 free credit to try it out and see if you can rely on PikaPods.
