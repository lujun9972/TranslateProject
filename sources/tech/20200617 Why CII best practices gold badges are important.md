Why CII best practices gold badges are important
======

On the _Linux Foundation_ blog, David A. Wheeler, Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security writes about CII Gold Badges:

_“…a CII Best Practices badge, especially a gold badge, shows that an OSS project has implemented a large number of good practices to keep the project sustainable, counter vulnerabilities from entering their software, and address vulnerabilities when found. Projects take many such steps to earn a gold badge, and it’s a good thing to see.”_
