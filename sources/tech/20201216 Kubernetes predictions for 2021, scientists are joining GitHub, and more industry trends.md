Kubernetes predictions for 2021, scientists are joining GitHub, and more industry trends
======
A weekly look at open source community and industry trends.
![Person standing in front of a giant computer screen with numbers, data][1]

As part of my role as a principal communication strategist at an enterprise software company with an open source development model, I publish a regular update about open source community, market, and industry trends. Here are some of my and their favorite articles from that update.

## [5 Kubernetes predictions for 2021][2]

> Enterprises can either spend their time and efforts on choosing, integrating, and testing an environment to build their own platform, or they can find a partner that delivers a platform that offers a combination of simplicity of use with the flexibility to leverage any projects and services to meet the requirements of the business.

**The impact**: A lot of these predictions could be summarized as "Kubernetes will be less and less the main show as what it enables comes to the forefront."

## [Looking ahead: Container, microservices, and serverless perspectives][3]

> When you use multiple clouds, it usually means there is going to be more interest in having an agnostic experience for delivering container-based workloads. This means that containers need to be able to run in any environment, programming language, operating system, etc. Moving forward, we anticipate more interest in  container platforms that adhere to standards like [Open Container Initiative (OCI)][4], whose main goal is to provide workload portability across many cloud providers through Runtime Specification and Image Specification standards. We anticipate these standards to become more widespread, as more organizations recognize the value of container portability, giving yourself flexibility when choosing a cloud provider, and the benefits of being able to connect to multiple environments.

**The impact**: While the terms "hybrid cloud" and "multi-cloud" are still at least somewhat for grabs, it seems pretty clear that containers are the agreed-upon packaging format.

## [The 2020 State of the Octoverse][5] (GitHub)

> Data analysts, scientists, students, teachers, and designers are joining GitHub, suggesting that collaborations on the platform will increasingly include more than just code.

**The impact**: Open source development conversations need more voice, perspectives, and contributions than are available in the development community. This is good news!

_I hope you enjoyed this list and come back next week for more open source community, market, and industry trends._
