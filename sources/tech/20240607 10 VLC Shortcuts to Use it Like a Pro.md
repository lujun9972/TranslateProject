10 VLC Shortcuts to Use it Like a Pro
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

VLC is a powerful open-source media player, known for its support for supporting an extensive range of audio and video formats.

Although VLC is more than just a media player, it is still popular for playing local media on the system.

Using keyboard shortcuts make things a lot easier in any tool and VLC is no different.

Here, we will be taking a look at X keyboard shortcuts, that will be helpful while using VLC.

### Pause and play

In order to pause any media, you can press the **Space** key. Similarly, press the **Space** key to resume playback.

Function | Shortcut
---|---
Pause/Resume | Space

### Control Volume

Most system provide a volume slider on the top panel, where we can adjust it by scrolling over it. In VLC, there is a volume button for the purpose.

Comparing these methods, it is easier to use the keyboard shortcut:

Function | Shortcut
---|---
Volume Up | CTRL + Up Arrow Key
Volume Down | CTRL + Down Arrow Key

### Mute and Unmute

During media playback, use the **M** key to mute. Press **M** again to unmute.

Function | Shortcut
---|---
Mute/Unmute | M

### Move forward or backward

Want to move a bit forward or backward while playing a media? better to remember the shortcut! VLC allows several levels of movement, through which you can fine control the time you are skipping.

üí°

You can use the ****E**** key to move one frame forward. This is useful, if you want to take a perfect snapshot of a frame.

It is pretty easy to remember these shortcuts, as we use the Right arrow key to move forward and Left to move backwards. As per context, the additional key changes.

Function | Shortcut
---|---
A Very Short backward/forward movement. (3 seconds) | SHIFT + Left/Right
Short backward/forward movement (10 seconds) | ALT + Left/Right
Medium backward/forward (60 seconds) | CTRL + Left/Right
Long backward/forward (300 seconds) | CTRL + ALT +Left/Right

üöß

****CTRL + ALT + Left/Right**** in GNOME is used to change workspaces.

#### Change the jump size

You can change the forward and backward jump size. First, go to **Tools ‚Üí Preferences**.

![Select Preferences][3]

Here, change the settings mode from Simple to All. This will bring you to advanced settings.

![Select All for Advanced Settings][4]

In the new advanced settings, go to **Interface ‚ÜíHotkeys** settings. There, you can find the option to adjust navigation lengths. Set it according to your need.

Once finished, you can use the **ESC** key to return to windowed mode.

üí°

While you are in full-screen mode, you can press the ****I**** key to get various controllers.

### Increase/decrease the speed

[VLC can play your video at different speed rates][6] as you specify. All of those are available through keyboard shortcuts as well.

Faster/Slower : 0.5x per key | \+ / -
Fine control speed (faster/slower respectively) : 0.10x per key | ] / [
