## 💡 Quick handy tip

It is possible to open man pages using Firefox. It opens the man page inside the GNOME Help app.

For this, first enter the following in the address bar of Firefox:

```

    man:<command>

```

There should not be any space. This will ask to open the Link with Help app. Click on open.

![][23]

Now, the man page will be opened inside the Help viewer. You can scroll to read. Interlink also works.

![][24]

**It works in other browsers too, if you have "Help" installed.**

## 🤣 Meme of the week

Oh, it does get confusing. But it would help if you refer to our list of the [best Linux distributions][25].
