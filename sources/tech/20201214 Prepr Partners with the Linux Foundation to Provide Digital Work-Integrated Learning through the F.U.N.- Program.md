Prepr Partners with the Linux Foundation to Provide Digital Work-Integrated Learning through the F.U.N.™ Program
======

Prepr is excited to announce a new partnership with The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, that will give work-integrated learning experiences to youth facing employment barriers. The new initiative, the Flexible Upskilling Network (F.U.N.™) program, launches in collaboration with the Magnet Network and the Network for the Advancement of Black Communities (NABC). The F.U.N.™ program is a blended learning program, where participants receive opportunities to combine valuable work experience with digital skill development over a 16-week journey. The objective of the F.U.N.™ program is to support youth, with a focus on women and visible minority groups who are involuntarily not in employment, education, or training (NEET) in Ontario, by helping them gain employability skills, including soft skills like communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.
