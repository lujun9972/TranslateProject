Community crossover, Rust at CNCF, and more industry trends
======
A weekly look at open source community and industry trends.
![Person standing in front of a giant computer screen with numbers, data][1]

As part of my role as a senior product marketing manager at an enterprise software company with an open source development model, I publish a regular update about open source community, market, and industry trends for product marketers, managers, and other influencers. Here are five of my and their favorite articles from that update.

## [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU Virtual – NEW schedule is live!][2]

> As our physical event has shifted to a virtual one, we have been taking thoughtful actions to create an immersive experience that provides you with interactive content and collaboration with peers. As an attendee, you will have the ability to network with other attendees, attend presentations with live Q&amp;A, interact with sponsors real-time, and much more.

**The impact**: Having recently moved an annual IRL event to virtual, I have some appreciation of what the CNCF is up against. The show must go on!

## [How the Changing Nature of Kubernetes Requires That You Rethink Both Architecture and Deployment][3]

> Is Kubernetes strategic to your hybrid cloud strategy? If so, you’re not alone. Two things are emerging: First, the need for Kubernetes to support more stateful applications. Second, there is a need for distributed Kubernetes (or Kube everywhere) applications where isolation of tenants is a requirement, as is the ability to efficiently manage shared resources.

**The impact**: This webinar shows that Kubernetes is not a silver bullet and that the promise of a multi-cloud abstraction layer won't be kept without a lot of careful thought and hard work on your part.

## [Rust at CNCF][4]

> I’m a huge fan of Rust myself, though I’ve really only [dabbled][5] in it. I have my fingers crossed that TiKV and Linkerd are just the beginning and that we’ll see a whole lot more Rust in the cloud native universe, be that in the form of new CNCF projects written in Rust, existing projects porting components into Rust, or new Rust client libraries for existing systems.

**The impact**: The Rust community has a reputation of welcoming loveliness; increased overlap in the Rust and CNCF Venn diagrams is a harbinger of good things for both communities.

## [Cloud Native Computing Foundation Announces Harbor Graduation][6]

> “The graduation marks a giant leap in recognizing the maturity of this excellent piece of software,” said Maxime Hurtrel, product manager at OVHcloud. “Harbor has made the registry more than a commodity, adding enterprise security and many integration points. OVHcloud is happy to be part of the adventure, democratizing Harbor both through our fully-managed offering built on Harbor and active development of the official Kubernetes operator. We look forward to future innovations by the Harbor project to the modern software deployment ecosystem.” 

**The impact**: Congrats to the Harbor team on de-commoditizing the registry!

_I hope you enjoyed this list and come back next week for more open source community, market, and industry trends._
