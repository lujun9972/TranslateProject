IBM Contributes A2O Processor Core and PowerAI as Open Source at OpenPOWER Summit
======

_Today at [OpenPOWER Summit 2020][1], IBM announced it is contributing two key technologies to the OpenPOWER community:_

  * _A2O POWER processor core, an out-of-order follow-up to the A2I core, and associated FPGA environment_
  * _Open Cognitive Environment (Open-CE), based on IBM’s PowerAI to enable improved consumability of AI and deep learning frameworks_



_The contributions follow the open sourcing of the [POWER ISA and associated reference designs in August 2019][2] and the [A2I POWER processor core in June 2020][3]. They represent IBM’s continued commitment to fostering innovation around the POWER architecture from the OpenPOWER ecosystem._
