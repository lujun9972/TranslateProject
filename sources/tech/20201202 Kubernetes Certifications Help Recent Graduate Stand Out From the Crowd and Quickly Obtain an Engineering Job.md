Med Ilyes El Ajroud is a recent graduate of the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin in France, having completed a degree studying computer science engineering. Graduating in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, El Ajroud worried about job prospects, even in the hot field of computer science. He wanted to make sure he could stand out from the crowd of recent graduates, and provide verification of his skills.
