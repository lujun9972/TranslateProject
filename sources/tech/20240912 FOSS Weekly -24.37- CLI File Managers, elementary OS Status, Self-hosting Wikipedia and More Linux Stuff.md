FOSS Weekly #24.37: CLI File Managers, elementary OS Status, Self-hosting Wikipedia and More Linux Stuff
======

[![Warp Terminal][1]][2]

Interested in improving your Linux command line knowledge? Our other project, Linux Handbook, launched a learning portal with a [course covering all the essential concepts, command-line operations, and system administration tasks][3].

Despite the name 'Linux for DevOps', it is a good resource for anyone who wants to sharpen their skills.

## 👷 Maker's Corner

[Migrating your Raspberry Pi OS installation to another SD card][19] is really effortless.

And something on [setting up a DIY panel for Home Assistant with Raspberry Pi][20].

Preserving the knowledge by self-hosting a part of the internet archive.

## 📹 Videos we are watching

An old video of Linus Torvalds introducing Linux 1.0 at the University of Helsinki. The video is 30 years old and, unsurprisingly, not in HD and not in the English language. Still, it's good to look back at one of the defining moments of tech history.

## ✨ App Of The Week

We have started a new segment over on It's FOSS News called “[App Of The Week][22]”, where we cover notable open-source apps for Linux. This week's app is [RustDesk][23], check it out!

![][12]

And don't forget the [Android FOSS app of the week][24].

## 🧩 Quiz Time

How sharp are your Grep skills? This [quiz][25] will test that.

## 💡 Quick Handy Tip

While typing fast, there's high chance you will accidentally hit the _Caps Lock_ key and continue typing, only to go back and delete the words.

In the latest GNOME releases, you can make pressing _Caps Lock_ and _Num Lock_ key produce a sound so that you know you didn't press those keys accidentally.

![][26]

To enable this, go to _Settings_ ➝ _Accessibility_ ➝ _Seeing_ , then turn on the “Sound Keys” option.

## 🤣 Meme of the Week

Being forced to use Windows at workplace is painful!

## 🗓️ Tech Trivia

September 9, 1945, was the day when the first computer “Bug” was discovered by operators of the [Harvard Mark II][28], who found a moth trapped in one of the relays. The famed Grace Hopper is attributed to coining the term 'debugging'. I also came across an [amusing old video of her from 1982][29]. You may find it interesting as well.
