Many other popular Linux distributions and free software projects are available in the HELLOTUX collection. The [partner program][5] allows not only the biggest Linux distributions, like Fedora, to participate but smaller free software projects, as well. [CentOS][6], [GNOME][7], [KDE][8], [LibreOffice][9], [VLC][10], [GIMP][11], [Inkscape][12], [Perl][13] and [Python][14] are some of the biggest free software projects, but there are smaller ones like [SourceHut][15], [Taskwarrior][16] and [DataLad][17], too.

Check out the embroidered [Fedora collection here][3], and don’t forget to use the **FEDORA5** coupon code for the $5 discount on every Fedora shirt, sweatshirt and laptop backpack.

### Special Offer

While our current supply lasts, when ordering four or more shirts, **your[Fedora laptop backpack][18] is a gift to you**.
