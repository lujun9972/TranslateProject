Welcome Antmicro to the OpenPOWER Foundation
======

OpenPOWER Foundation Executive Director James Kulina writes:

_This May, [Antmicro announced support for the POWER ISA in Renode][1], its open source, multi-architecture, heterogeneous multi-core capable simulator for software development and software-hardware co-development._

_It’s an exciting development, as developers can now test applications based on the POWER ISA before running them on actual hardware. It’s an important step in achieving the vision of the OpenPOWER Foundation – to make POWER the easiest architecture on which to go from an idea to a silicon chip._

_I recently caught up with [Michael Gielda][2], VP of business development, to discuss Antmicro, its role in the OpenPOWER Foundation ecosystem and its beliefs on open source hardware in general._
