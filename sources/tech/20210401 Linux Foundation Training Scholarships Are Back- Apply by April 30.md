Linux Foundation Training Scholarships Are Back! Apply by April 30
======

[Linux Foundation Training (LiFT) Scholarships][1] are back! Since 2011, The Linux Foundation has awarded over 600 scholarships for more than a million dollars in training and certification to deserving individuals around the world who would otherwise be unable to afford it. This is part of our mission to grow the open source community by lowering the barrier to entry and making quality training options accessible to those who want them.

[Applications][2] are being accepted through April 30 in 10 different categories:

  * Open Source Newbies
  * Teens-in-Training
  * Women in Open Source
  * Software Developer Do-Gooder
  * SysAdmin Super Star
  * Blockchain Blockbuster
  * Cloud Captain
  * Linux Kernel Guru
  * Networking Notable
  * Web Development Wiz



Whether you are just starting in your open source career, or you are a veteran developer or sysadmin who is looking to gain new skills, if you feel you can benefit from training and/or certification but cannot afford it, you should apply. 

Recipients will receive a Linux Foundation training course and certification exam. All our certification exams, and most training courses, are offered remotely, meaning they can be completed from anywhere. 

Winners will be announced early summer.

[Apply today!][2]
