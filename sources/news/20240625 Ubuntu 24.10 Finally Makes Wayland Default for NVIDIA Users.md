Ubuntu 24.10 Finally Makes Wayland Default for NVIDIA Users
======
Great news for Ubuntu NVIDIA users!
[![][1]][2]

As is typical after an Ubuntu LTS release, [24.04][3] in this case. The development of a non-LTS (interim) release is underway. Code-named “ **Oracular Oriole** ”, Ubuntu 24.10 is set to be released sometime in October 2024, barring any unforeseen delays, of course.

Such releases usually have a **very short support cycle of just 9 months** , and feature plenty of interesting changes that set the stage for future LTS releases, while also acting as a proving ground for new stuff.

With the development of 24.10 in full swing, one such change has caught my attention. NVIDIA users will finally have a Wayland experience out of the box 🥳

### Ubuntu 24.10: A Wayland Future Awaits

![A development build of Ubuntu 24.10 running on a Virtual Machine][4]

When Ubuntu 24.04 LTS released, we [already knew][5] that this was coming. Starting with the Ubuntu 24.10 release, **the Wayland session will be the default one for NVIDIA users**.

You see, the developers had shared [a roadmap][6] last month when they revealed that:

> In Ubuntu 24.10 we’re also planning to take the plunge and switch to Wayland by default for those with NVIDIA graphics cards.

If you were wondering; **Why not do it with the 24.04 release?**

Well, at the time, the developers felt that there were still a few known issues with this implementation when it came to heavy use cases like VFX, AI/ML, and a few others; stating that it was too early for a switch.

But now, **the developers are confident that this can be enabled on the interim release** , as this gives them time to look for any unknown issues, and bugs before the upcoming Ubuntu 26.04 LTS release, which is less than 2 years away.

Their increased confidence could also be attributed to the fact that explicit sync support [landed in Wayland][7] back in April, and the likes of GNOME and KDE Plasma have already implemented it into their projects.

In the case of NVIDIA, the upcoming [555 driver][9] series is going to set the stage for supporting explicit sync and GSP firmware by default on NVIDIA GPUs, making way for better compatibility and performance.

#### Want to check it out?

The above-mentioned changes are already live on the daily builds of Ubuntu 24.10 thanks to a [recent change][10] done to the GDM session manager.

You can grab it from the [official website][11], but do keep in mind that these builds are not meant for production/daily use, as things often break when using these.
