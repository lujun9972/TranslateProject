FreeBSD Wants More People Using It on Laptops and Here’s Their Plan
======
Do you want FreeBSD on your laptop? Maybe now is the perfect time to
give it a try!
[![][1]][2]

In a world full of Linux and Windows-based operating systems, there are some [BSD][3]-based derivatives that aim to challenge the status quo by offering a more efficient, secure, and reliable family of operating systems.

One such option is [FreeBSD][4], which is certainly one of the most popular BSD variants out there. Its focus has long been on server and embedded [platforms][5], with comparatively less attention being paid to the more casual/common side of the computing market, namely laptop users.

Luckily, things are about to get better in this regard thanks to a new initiative from the [FreeBSD Foundation][6] in partnership with some key stakeholders, which will see a greater emphasis on laptop support.

📋

The FreeBSD Foundation is responsible for the FreeBSD project, including legal affairs.

### FreeBSD To Focus On Laptops: What To Expect?

![Just a stand-in image of the FreeBSD website.][7]

In collaboration with [Quantum Leap Research][8], the FreeBSD Foundation has **earmarked $750,000 in funding to expand laptop and general platform support in FreeBSD** by focusing on a handful of key objectives.

From that, $250,000 will come from Quantum Leap Research and $500,000 from the FreeBSD Foundation. The **total targeted amount for the project is set at a hefty $1 million** , with other organizations like [Dell][9], [AMD][10], and [Framework][11] also set to chip in 🤯

The foundation is looking to make up the $250,000 deficit by inviting financial support from other organizations as well. ( _NVIDIA could set aside some dollars, couldn't they? 🤷_ )

#### Where Does The Money Go?

Just a month ago, FreeBSD had received a [€686,400 funding boost][12] from the Sovereign Tech Fund, and now it appears that they are putting it to good use.

With this, **they intend to fill the gaps in laptop support for FreeBSD** that have long been hindering the operating system's mainstream adoption. The initiative will be focusing on the following key areas:

  * Improving wireless connectivity by bolstering chipset support.
  * Upgrading FreeBSD's scheduler to support [heterogeneous computing][13].
  * Providing better support for Intel and AMD GPUs by integrating the latest DRM drivers.
  * Handling novel buttons, touchpad gestures, and any such unique hardware components found on modern laptops.
  * Upgrading audio performance by implementing better audio routing, headphone switching, and digital microphone ( _DMIC_ ) functionality.
  * Working on bringing modern power-saving techniques like _s2idle_ and _s0ix_ to improve suspend/resume behavior as well as battery life on laptops.



By doing all this, they are **also aiming to increase corporate adoption of FreeBSD** by catering to individuals and businesses that prioritize [endpoint security][14].

Interestingly, Quantum Leap Research has revealed that they **intend to run FreeBSD as a hypervisor-like solution** by employing [Bhyve][15] on their laptops to virtualize other operating systems like Linux and Windows.

During the announcement, [Deb Goodkin][16], Executive Director at the FreeBSD Foundation, added that:

> This initiative marks a major step forward for FreeBSD, especially for users who rely on laptops for their daily computing needs. By expanding hardware support and enhancing usability features, we are making FreeBSD more accessible to a broader audience.

They also made a call to action to get others to chip in to their efforts by [donating][17] to the foundation to help propel FreeBSD to the next level. You can learn more about this initiative by going through the [announcement blog][18].

_💬 Are you looking forward to running FreeBSD on your laptop? I sure am! I can't wait to see how this effort pans out._
