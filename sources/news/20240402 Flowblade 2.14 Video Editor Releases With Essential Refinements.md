Flowblade 2.14 Video Editor Releases With Essential Refinements
======
Flowblade 2.14 is here!
Video editors on Linux can be a hit or miss. Depending on the kind of work you aim to do, you have [many options][1]. But, many professionals prefer [Adobe Premiere Pro][2] for its arsenal of features and adaptability. Sadly, official support for that on Linux is non-existent.

Luckily, video editors for Linux are getting better with every passing day. Take, for instance, [Flowblade][3], that has received significant upgrades with a recent release.

Let's take a look at how it fares.

### Flowblade 2.14: What to Expect?

![][4]

Marketed as a _multitrack, non-linear video editor_ , Flowblade is **an open-source offering** that can cater to professionals of all skill levels thanks to its wide array of tools and features that make it so good.

There are a few highlights to the Flowblade 2.14 release that I will get into later in this article. But, one of the more exciting points is that **Flowblade will have a GTK4 port sometime in 2025**. The developers are busy working on it, and when they are done, you can expect a better performing app that feels more modern.

#### New Additions

Don't let the above distract you from the fact that there are plenty of new features with this release of Flowblade. We start off with the **newly included support for USB** [**Jog/Shuttle**][5] that added around 2,000 lines of new code to the video editor.

Initially, three devices from Contour Design will be supported, the [Shuttle Pro V2][6], [ShuttleXpress][7], and the older SpaceShuttle.

Then there's the **ability to drag graphics clips to longer lengths** , **slo-mo playback at 10 fps** via the “ _Ctrl+Left/Right Arrow_ ” keyboard shortcut, and **pasting as insert now being done on the playhead position**.

#### Improved Filters

Filters are also where you will see a host of improvements, with some highlights being the new _Elastic_ distort and _Compressor_ filters, updated _Waves_ filter with effect animation, addition of a new “ _sense_ ” property to _avfilter.perspective_ , and more.

#### Other Changes and Improvements

There are also several notable changes, that include:

  * The Filter Select panel's width can now be changed.
  * New keyboard shortcut “ _Alt+A_ ” for appending selected media to the timeline.
  * A fix for GPU rendering with _hevc_nvenc_ encoding for better support with _FFmpeg 6.0_ and later.
  * Better zoom controls with one more zoom step that will make it easier to work with single frame clips.



For more details about this release, you can refer to the [release notes][8].

### Get Flowblade 2.14

The most simple way of getting the latest Flowblade release is to get it from the [Flathub store][9]. However, if you are feeling adventurous, you can head over to its [GitHub repo][10], where you will find the source code.

[Flowblade (Flathub Store)][9]

You can also refer to the official [install guide][11] for alternative means of installation.
