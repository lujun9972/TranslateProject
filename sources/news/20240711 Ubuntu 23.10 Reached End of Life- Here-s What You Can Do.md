Ubuntu 23.10 Reached End of Life: Here's What You Can Do!
======
It's important for you to upgrade now that Ubuntu 23.10 has reached EOL,
and we tell you how to do that here.
[![][1]][2]

Ubuntu's release cycle might be a surprise to you if you have been a long-time user of Windows. With there being a major [long-term supported][3] (LTS) release every two years, and interim releases in-between to accommodate new software and improvements that get rolled out regularly.

Many users like jumping onto the interim releases for taking advantage of newer kernels, software, and the bleeding-edge of what the Linux ecosystem has to offer.

But, there's a cost to it, its end-of-life (EOL) period is shorter, just like [Ubuntu 23.10][4] support period ends today.

### Don't Get Caught Out By Ubuntu 23.10

![][5]

Starting tomorrow ( _12 July 2024_ ), **Ubuntu 23.10 will stop receiving bug fixes, critical security patches, and really any other kind of updates** from [Canonical][6], meaning that users can only update their installed applications, but not their operating system.

This marks the end of the standard nine-month support period for this interim Ubuntu release.

Obviously, **this is a really concerning situation** , more so if you are running it in an enterprise setting on a large pool of devices connected to the internet. As illustrated by the table above, standard support for 23.10 ends on July 2024, and there is no option to extend by using [Ubuntu Pro][7].

But, that doesn't have to be the end of it. You can easily upgrade to the next best version, [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS][8]. Keep on reading to learn how.

### Check Ubuntu Version

![][9]

Before you begin, do confirm whether you are running 23.10 by running the following command in the terminal:

```

    lsb_release -a

```

![][10]

You can also head over to the Settings app, then under “ _About_ ”, see what Ubuntu version you are running.

### Upgrading to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

After ensuring you have backed up any important data, open the _Software & Updates_ app, and under the “ _Updates_ ” tab, ensure that you are being notified for all new Ubuntu versions by going to the last menu item and selecting “ _For any new version_ ”.

![][11]

Then run the following command to update the system:

```

    sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade

```

Then run the Update Manager, restart your computer, if prompted:

```

    sudo update-manager

```

The Software Updater should pop up with an option to “ _Upgrade…_ ”, click on it and follow the on-screen instructions.

![][12]

Thereafter, it will ask you whether you want to upgrade your system, with a summary of all the packages that will be added, removed, and upgraded.

Along the process, it may ask you to decide on some essential preferences, and after those are chosen, your system will reboot, completing the upgrade process.

If you are eager to learn more about how Ubuntu handles its release cycle, you can visit the [official website][13].

_💬 That was it for this one. Do let me know how your upgrade experience goes!_ _Or, did you decide to do a fresh installation / switch away to a new distro?_
