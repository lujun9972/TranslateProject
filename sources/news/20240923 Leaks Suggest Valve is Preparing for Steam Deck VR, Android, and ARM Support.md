Leaks Suggest Valve is Preparing for Steam Deck VR, Android, and ARM Support
======
What is Valve cooking this time? Interesting things to look out for!
[![][1]][2]

[Valve][3] and their online video game store, [Steam][4], are an important part of the gaming scene on Linux. Ever since they launched the [Proton][5] compatibility layer and the [Steam Deck][6], their popularity among Linux gamers has been on the rise.

While some game developers [seem to think][7] that Valve has to do all the heavy lifting on providing Steam Deck support for games, they have been doing well.

And, with [a recent leak][8], it appears that they are venturing into newer horizons when it comes to hardware support.

**What's Happening:** Spotted on [SteamDB][9], _ValveTestApp3043620_ is a test application which shows that Valve is **working on** [**ARM64**][10] **support for Proton**. There is a good deal of evidence that they are testing it across many games, both VR and non-VR.

In the changelist for the app, you will also see mentions of some interesting stuff, like **Proton Experimental** , which is the bleeding-edge version of the compatibility layer used to take advantage of the latest fixes.

And [Waydroid][12], a container-based solution that facilitates the running of a fully equipped Android system on Linux computers with the Wayland session.

You will also find many games on that list; some notable ones include the likes of [Moss: Book II][13], [Open Brush][14], [Garry's Mod][15], [Papers Please][16], and [Frostpunk][17].

**What To Expect:** Well, there are many things that you could expect out of Valve's work. The first possibility might be that **they are readying up support for the** [rumored][18] **Valve Index 2** **VR headset** , given that there are many VR games on the list.

The second would be that they are focusing their efforts on **bringing Steam support to laptops with ARM processors**.

Another potential scenario could be that they are **working on bringing support for the** [**Android**][19] **software** to Steam (on Linux, preferably), expanding the access to software for users.

There's also talk of **an ARM-based Steam Deck** , which might be yet another reason behind all this testing. But, ultimately, I don't work at Valve, so at this point, these are speculations about what this thing might be about.
