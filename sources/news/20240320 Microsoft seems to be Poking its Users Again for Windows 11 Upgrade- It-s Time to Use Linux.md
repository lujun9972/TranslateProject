Microsoft seems to be Poking its Users Again for Windows 11 Upgrade: It's Time to Use Linux!
======
It's time to talk about switching to Linux, again!
Just another Microsoft annoyance.

Nothing too exciting, but Microsoft's recent aggressive push to encourage Windows 10 users to consider a Windows 11 upgrade is not going so well 🙄

Last month, Microsoft announced that it is [expanding invitations][1] to move users to Windows 11. In addition, they have been pushing the reminders more and more since January 2024.

Why?

**The reason** : **** _Windows 10 will reach the end of support on October 14, 2025._

While some surrendered to the notification and did the upgrade (with regrets?), some are annoyed by the reminders, and some are disappointed because their systems are not eligible for the update.

Sure, it has been a while since Windows 11 released. But, everything associated with it has been annoying from the get-go. For instance, my system equipped with an i5-11600k, 32 GB RAM, and an RTX 3060 Ti is not eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade:

I have to enable a little setting from the BIOS menu to make that happen, but I am not interested at the moment. So, a little annoyance, still an annoyance 😑

And, hey, I have Fedora for Linux, and Windows for a couple of games. Or, maybe because it is said that one should keep their enemy close 😉

### Windows 11 Upgrade: Stay With Annoyances or Switch to Linux!

![][3]

Of course, I would want everyone to use [Linux instead of Windows][4] for all the benefits.

That being said, you do not have much time with Windows 10 even if I wanted to say " _it is okay to keep using what you like_ ".

And, if you are considering upgrading to Windows 11, **I do want you to give it a second thought, and consider a Linux distro instead.**

![][5]

Why?

  * **Peacefully use your operating system without future annoyances like this**
  * **Keep your system secure with fewer efforts**
  * **Avoiding Windows 11 experience-breaking bugs**
  * **Get the most out of your existing system without needing to upgrade hardware**



And, it's not me saying without Windows 11 experience.

I have tried Windows 11 on my laptop, and it is not a pretty experience (some parts of the UI may look good though).

So, if you think that you need peace over nudges from Microsoft, and can make some extra time to make the switch, I think it would be worth it!

### How Do You Make the Switch?

![][6]

Assuming you are convinced to make the switch, how do you do that? Fret not, I shall highlight you everything you need to follow (and **it's super easy!** ).

  1. Get an idea of [what Linux is][7]
  2. Explore the [essential applications available for Linux][8]. You have almost everything you require, except things like Adobe suite.
  3. Pick one of the [best Linux distributions][9] (I recommend Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Pop!_OS).
  4. [Learn the terminal basics][10] to get comfortable with the command-line _(optional)_.



If you find a software that is not available for Linux systems, the good news is you can still try to run [Windows apps on Linux][11]:

![][12]

The same goes for Windows-exclusive games or stores. You can refer to our guides here:

  * [Using Epic Games Store on Linux][13]
  * [Playing GOG Games on Linux][14]



📋

You can choose to test drive the [Linux distros in a virtual machine][15] before you try to install, or try it on bare metal.

You can pick any of the [virtualization software][16] like VirtualBox, and [install Linux inside VirtualBox][17] for testing.

If you are going ahead installing Linux, you can refer to our tutorial here for Ubuntu:

![][12]

In case you face issues installing, you might want to [disable secure boot][18] first.

💬 _So, what is it going to be? Would you choose to upgrade or try the switch to Linux?_

Have you already switched to Linux and agree with my thoughts? Maybe you can try to share this with your Windows friends to convince them to try the switch!
