7 Features That Make Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Cool
======
Curious what Ubuntu's next big LTS release brings? We tell you all about
it here.
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS 'Noble Numbat' release is a little more than a month away ü§©

So, you have plenty of time to decide whether you want to upgrade or not. Of course, if you are using a non-LTS Ubuntu release like Ubuntu 23.10, you must upgrade in some time.

But, if you are using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, you might have to think about it.

Fret not, I took the daily build for a test drive. Here, let me highlight the best bits of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS to help you make that decision easy.

### 1\. 12 Years of Updates

Canonical revealed that [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS will receive updates for 12 years][1] (including the extension period with the Pro subscription).

What does that mean? Here you go:

Usually, you get **five years of maintenance+security updates** , and then **five more as part of the extended maintenance cycle** with [Ubuntu Pro][2].

üí°

Ubuntu Pro is free for personal users, covering up to five systems.

Now, the extension period is seven years, instead of five, making it 12.

### 2\. Installer Improvements

Canonical has been laser-focused on improving the installation experience, and it has been going in the right direction.

The modern user experience along with the easy-to-follow screens should enhance the onboarding experience for new users.

![][4]

With Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, they fine-tuned it further with an accessibility option setting to come right after the first screen.

Next, they have made other screens a little "prettier" and informative with icons around the process, like a network Wi-Fi icon in the connection selection screen:

![][5]

Not just limited to that, the installer now defaults to the "minimal" installation mode:

![][6]

So, you do not get plenty of unnecessary utilities (if you don't need them).

However, if you require a selection of tools to start with, you can opt for the "Full installation".

Of course, the option to install third-party software and additional media codecs still exists.

### 3\. Software Center Big Update + Tweaks

If you are jumping from a previous LTS release, the new Flutter-based software center is a refreshing experience. It [debuted with Ubuntu 23.10][7].

The user interface looks pretty sleek and offers a good user experience with a modern touch.

![][8]

Moreover, with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, the apps are organized in such a way where you will find different sections of top apps to help you find useful apps.

Not just limited to that, the screen to manage/check for installed apps also got an overhaul where you get the details in an organized manner.

![][9]

You can choose to filter the list, check for updates, update all of them, and manage them. Something similar to how we manage/list apps on Android.

So, you know what works best and what most of the users like to use.

### 4\. GNOME 46

The latest and greatest GNOME 46 is planned to be baked in with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

Presently, the daily builds do not feature GNOME 46 yet. However, considering GNOME 46 is now in its beta phase, it should not be long for the implementation with Ubuntu.

You can expect refinements to GNOME settings, with tweaks for a more organized layout and other new features. Some of it can be seen in the recent builds.

A new entry " **Security & Privacy**" instead of just Privacy:

![][10]

If you compare it to Ubuntu 23.10, options like _Users, Default Apps, Date & Time,_ and ***** Region & Language* have been moved under a new menu " **System** ".

![][11]

Of course, Ubuntu's approach for GNOME 46 will be a bit different from the vanilla experience. So, we shall update the information here when we have more on this.

Not just limited to the visual changes, you can expect the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS repository to include [GNOME's new image viewer Loupe][12], and the [webcam app Snapshot][13].

For instance, install the webcam app using the following command:

```

    sudo apt install gnome-snapshot

```

Snap or no snap ‚Äî personally, I like the convenience of Ubuntu app compatibilty. Hence, I came back to Ubuntu right after switching to Fedora...

![][14]

### 5\. Series of Snaps

This may not turn out to be the most-loved feature. However, a convenience for some users.

You can install a series of productivity snaps (electron wrapped versions) with a single command, like the Google Suite apps, or Office 365.

While this sounds like something that should work across other Ubuntu versions as well, the desktop integration with it will be interesting to see here.

### 6\. Dedicated Security App + Other Bits

A separate security app (or center) is in the [official roadmap][16] for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. We do not know for sure if it will happen at all (or the progress).

However, the aim of the security app is to expose settings/features to every user that only Linux ninjas could utilize, including re-encryption of hardware-backed full-disk encryption. You can expect simple toggle/checkboxes for security features.

Moreover, a prompt mechanism has been planned for resource access requests by confined applications. The security center would be listing these requests along with the already existing privacy permission controls, making it closer to how Android handles privacy.

The Pro settings along with a new network section is also something aimed for the new security center. Users should be able to access firewall toggles and any other features like stealth mode here.

### 7\. Improved Notifications

The notifications for Snap app updates will be more meaningful with an action prompt available.

![][17]

Not just limited to Snap apps, there are plans to add an indicator to the app's dock icon to inform the user that an update is available. It should be helpful even if you dismiss the update prompt.

### 8\. Linux Kernel 6.6

Ubuntu 24.04 features the latest [Linux Kernel 6.6][18] LTS with various improvements for laptops, and other networking refinements.

You can explore more about the kernel in our older coverage:
