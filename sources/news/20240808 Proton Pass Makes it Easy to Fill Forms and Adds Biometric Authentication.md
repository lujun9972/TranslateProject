Proton Pass Makes it Easy to Fill Forms and Adds Biometric Authentication
======
Subtle improvements to Proton Pass, not bad!
[![][1]][2]

People who go the extra mile in [improving their privacy][3] in the online world, are most likely aware of the various privacy-focused brands out there that act as strong alternatives to Big Tech options out there.

[Proton][4] has been one of those brands that's been consistently delivering new updates to their [existing services][5], while also venturing into [newer waters][6] by bringing their tech to many new ones.

Similarly, they have now introduced some noteworthy upgrades to their password manager offering, Proton Pass, so let's check it out.

### Proton Pass Upgrades: What to Expect?

![][7]

There are **two major additions** that have arrived, the first is **support for biometric authentication** for the Windows and macOS apps, which allows users to log in into Proton Pass by using [Windows Hello][8] and [Touch ID][9].

This has given the users an additional layer of security, that facilitates the use of fingerprints or facial recognition to log in to the service, getting rid of the need to remember a password.

Unfortunately, **this feature is not yet made available for Linux**.

The second addition to the password manager is the new “ **Identities** ” feature that lets users **securely store personal information** like names, addresses, identification numbers, websites, etc. and even custom fields.

With this, Proton Pass users can store such information for easy autofilling when filling out forms on websites, while also minimizing the risk of entering erroneous data when in a hurry.

This should provide you a more secure and accessible way of handling sensitive information than just trusting your web browser's autofill feature.

When talking about these new additions, [Son Nguyen Kim][10], Product Lead for Proton Pass, said that:

> With the introduction of identities and biometric authentication, Proton Pass is significantly boosting productivity for our users.
>
> These features not only enhance our security offerings but also streamline everyday tasks, allowing users to save time and reduce stress in managing their digital lives.

If are looking to learn more about this, you should go through the official [announcement blog][11].

### 📥 Get Proton Pass

If you are an existing user of Proton Pass, just update the clients for your devices, either from the store app for mobile, or from within the client for desktop.

**For new users** , they can sign up for a Proton account by visiting the [official website][12] ( _partner link_ ), where they will find both free and paid plans.
