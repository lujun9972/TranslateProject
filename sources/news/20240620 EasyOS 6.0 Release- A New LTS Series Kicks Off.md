======
EasyOS 6.0 is an interesting Linux distro upgrade for a new LTS series,
supported until 2028. Find out more here.

EasyOS is quite a unique Linux distribution that sees its start back in 2017 when it was derived off Quirky Linux. It has been built up along the years with many [unique qualities][3].

Its developers call it as the “ _new paradigm_ ” for distros which has been designed to be container-friendly, and uses RAM to handle its storage operations, which usually result in fast app/container launches.

Thanks to a recent announcement, we now have a new release in the form of **EasyOS Scarthgap 6.0**. Let's see what it has to offer.

### EasyOS Scarthgap 6.0: What's New?

![Source: Barry's News][5]

Powered by [Linux kernel 6.6.32][6], it features packages that were compiled from a fork of the [Scarthgap release][7] of OpenEmbedded which is an LTS release supported until April 2028.

Alongside that, there is a “ _meta-quirky_ ” layer by [Barry Kauler][8], which features an **additional 240 package build recipes** not present on the official OpenEmbedded and Yocto Project repos alongside multiple patches for the official build recipes.

**On the application side of things** , EasyOS 6.0 features recent versions of apps like Geany, GParted, Grisbi, Inkscape, LibreOffice, NoteCase, Celluloid, Chromium, Flowblade, GIMP, and a few others.

To wrap this up, there are plenty of [updated packages][9] too, with some notable ones including:

  * **glibc 2.39**
  * **GCC 13.2.0**
  * **Mesa 24.0.3**
  * **Python 3.12.3**
  * **LLVM/Clang 18.1.5**



The [release notes][10] have more details if you would like to learn more about this release.

### Get EasyOS Scarthgap 6.0

The most straightforward way to get this release of EasyOS is to get it from the [official mirror][11] hosted at Ibiblio. There is also a [Yocto Project][12] page that hosts EasyOS releases, but at the time of writing, it featured an older release.

There is another mirror for users in Europe, hosted by [NLUUG][13], that could be a faster alternative to the above-mentioned ones.

[EasyOS Scarthgap 6.0 (Ibiblio)][9]

For users of the earlier “Kirkstone” releases, they can follow the official [upgrade guide][14] to get the newer release, as **that series of releases will stop receiving maintenance updates** by the end of this year.
