======
The AI-powered Rusty Linux terminal is now available for Linux on ARM.

Pitched as a modern terminal emulator, Warp is a cool Rust-based app that is quite intuitive in nature. Though **not everyone is a fan of its closed-source nature** , we cover it because it is offered for Linux.

Since the last time I [took a look][3] at Warp, it has been growing at a remarkable pace, with many users liking the functionalities it has to offer.

Now, with a recent [announcement][4], the developers of Warp have announced that it is now available on Linux for the [ARM][5] platform, further increasing the terminal emulator's reach.

Users can choose between packages such as _.deb_ , _.rpm_ , _AppImage_ , and _.tar.gz_. Meanwhile, for Windows users, the wait for Warp is still ongoing.

With this, users of [SBC][8]s, [Chromebooks][9], and even devices that are set to come equipped with the upcoming [Snapdragon X series][10] of processors can take advantage of the various features of Warp.

If you are looking for **a refresher on Warp's features** , then you'll want to read on:

You get to take advantage of AI command suggestions, AI autofill, an IDE-like editing experience, support for custom themes, access to cloud-powered features via Warp Drive, and more.

### Want to Check it Out?

You can grab the latest ARM build for Warp from the [official website][11] ( _partner link_ ), where you will also find other packages for x64 Linux and macOS.
