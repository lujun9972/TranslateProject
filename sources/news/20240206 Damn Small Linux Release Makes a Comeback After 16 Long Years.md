Damn Small Linux Release Makes a Comeback After 16 Long Years
======
Damn Small Linux 2024 makes a return!
[Damn Small Linux][1] (DSL) is a name that we haven't heard for quite some time now, with a very low-key announcement, the developers have unveiled a new release in the form of **DSL 2024**.

Based on the [antiX 23 release][2], DSL is leveraging one of the [best lightweight distributions][3] out there for providing a unique experience in a sea of Debian-based and Fedora-based distros.

If you haven't heard of DSL, it used to be a very compact distro that was just 50 MB in size, but that has now changed to better accommodate the current state of computing. Don't worry, this is **still a great option for older computers** with humble specifications.

Interestingly, **the last major release of DSL came back in 2008!** So, let's see what this release has to offer. 😃

**Suggested Read** 📖

🚧

We tried out the Alpha version of DSL, don't consider it to be the final version you'll get.

### Damn Small Linux 2024: What to Expect?

![][5]

Introduced as an alpha release, DSL 2024 features [Linux kernel 5.10][6] and [Debian 12 'Bookworm'][7] at its core thanks to the antiX base that it uses. It is offered with **two window managers** , [Fluxbox][8] and [JWM][9], with **apt being fully enabled by default** for easy package installations.

All of that has resulted in **a considerable increase in the ISO size** for DSL that now stands at around 700 MB (698.13 MB to be precise), one of the developers cited that:

> While it would be possible to make a bootable Xwindows 50MB distribution today, it would be missing many drivers and have only a handful of very rudimentary applications.

> People would find such a distribution a fun toy or something to build upon, but it would not be usable for the average computer user out of the gate.

And I agree with that, pulling off something that is so compact is quite tricky to do nowadays, with only a select few ables to do that while also providing a decent desktop experience.

Off the top of my head, the likes of [Puppy Linux][10], [EasyOS][11], and [Tiny Core][12] are the options that I can recommend to someone if they were looking for a compact Linux distro.

To get to this number, the lead developer had to do plenty of research to find applications with a low storage footprint, limit the language options, remove a bunch of source code, man pages, documentation and what not.

In line with that, **the new goal of DSL** is now to provide as much of a usable desktop experience as possible that can fit on a single CD with a hard limit of 700 MB. The developers intend DSL to cater to older computers, letting them be usable for as long as possible.

With what short usage I did, the **Fluxbox window manager seemed to perform really well** , there were many themes to choose from; the desktop was also quite snappy, even when running on a [virtual machine][14] using Virtual Box on Ubuntu.

The **application suite is quite extensive** too, with the following highlights:

  * [zzzFM][15], as the file manager.
  * [mtPaint][16], for graphics editing.
  * [BadWolf][17], the default web browser.
  * [Tmux][18], as the terminal multiplexer.



For more details on the other apps, and changes with this new release of DSL, you may head over to the [official website][1].

### 📥 Get Damn Small Linux 2024

At the time of writing, **only the Alpha ISOs were made available** on the official [downloads page][19]. It is only a matter of time before we get a stable release.

[Damn Small Linux 2024 (Alpha)][19]

If you have any doubts regarding the distro, then you can head over to the [DSL forums][20].
