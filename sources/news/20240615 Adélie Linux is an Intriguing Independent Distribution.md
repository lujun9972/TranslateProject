Adélie Linux is an Intriguing Independent Distribution
======
It's been a while since we checked out an independent Linux
distribution. Adélie Linux sounds interesting.
[![][1]][2]

You know, in the sea of Debian/Fedora-based Linux distributions, whenever I come across [independent Linux distros][3] that are built from scratch, I always tend to get curious, with only one question in mind: What's different?

[Adélie Linux][4] is one such distro, a lightweight Linux distribution that caters to a wide variety of platforms, whether it is a **desktop, clusters, or a server**.

🚧

This is an under development project that cannot be recommended for production use.

### Adélie Linux: Overview ⭐

![][5]

When I checked out the [Adélie Linux 1.0-BETA5][6] release, it was running a highly customized version of Linux kernel 5.15 and was based on the [musl libc][7] library.

With this foundation, they aim to become a **POSIX certified distribution**.

Some **key highlights** include:

  * **Lightweight Nature**
  * **Minimal User Interface**
  * **Wide Platform Support**



#### Initial Impressions 👨‍💻

I tried installing it on a virtual machine, and I was glad to see that Adélie let me choose the desktop environment, with options to install a text-only session and a customized session with packages of my choice.

Sadly, it got stuck during the installation process, and I had to switch back to the live session to check what Adélie had to offer. Bare metal is a better choice for testing this distro out.

I moved on. The desktop was a clean yet familiar experience, thanks to the older [KDE Plasma 5.24.5][9] release featured with Adélie Linux.

The other desktop environment options include [LXQt][10], [MATE][11] and [Xfce][12].

The pre-installed applications on offer are dominated by the [wide range][14] of apps from KDE, and there was also a minimal web browser, [NetSurf][15] which handled the internet-based tasks.

For a complete list of apps and packages, you can refer to the official [packages page][16].

![][17]

With what I saw, this distro can be a daily driver for someone who likes to have a fully fledged experience on various hardware architectures (server or desktop).

Unlike numerous other projects, it does not claim to reinvent anything. It just puts forward the goal of POSIX compliance, Libre, user freedom, and privacy. I guess that makes me feel that their development approach must be focused, which is a good thing. Don't you agree? 😄

### 📥 Get Adélie Linux

Adélie Linux is offered for a wide variety of CPU architectures with different flavors, such as _Server_ , _Desktop_ , _Full Rootfs_ and _Mini Rootfs_.

You can pick the image that works best for your use case on the [official website][18].
