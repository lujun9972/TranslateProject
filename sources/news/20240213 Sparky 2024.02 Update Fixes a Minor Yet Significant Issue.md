Sparky 2024.02 Update Fixes a Minor Yet Significant Issue
======
SparkyLinux adds much-needed refinements.
SparkyLinux is a [lightweight distro][1] based on Debian that offers a high degree of customizability.

It offers a stable edition and a semi-rolling release.

Almost a month after [SparkyLinux 2024.01 release][2], we now have a new point release for the semi-rolling edition featuring some important tweaks and improvements.

So, let's check those out!

## 🆕 SparkyLinux 2024.02: What's New?

![][4]

Equipped with **Linux kernel 6.6.13** , this release features upgraded packages from the Debian and Sparky testing repositories until February 11, 2024. There are also **a few other Linux kernel options** available from the Sparky repos; 6.7.4, 6.6.16-LTS, 6.1.77-LTS, 5.15.148-LTS.

The SparkyLinux 2024.02 release focuses on providing some much-needed improvements, over providing new features. We start off with **the CLI installer** that now sees support for [XFS][5] and [Btrfs][6] making a comeback.

Support for those file systems had to be dropped due to the GRUB bootloader not playing nice; that has now been fixed. Then there's the **ability to not set a root password** , when you choose that, the user password will be used instead.

For **Sparky Backup** , [memtest86+][8] was added to the live EFI boot menu, **a new UEFI firmware configurator** for the live EFI GRUB menu. In addition, the **ability to create EFI-compatible ISOs** even if you don't have GRUB-EFI debs in your home/offline directory.

That sounds pretty exciting! 🤩

And, a couple more important bits:

  * [PipeWire 1.0.3][9] package handles the audio/video department
  * Inclusion of [GRUB 2.12][10]
  * Fixes for Sparky Tray that have resulted in quick access to a few system tools



You can go through the official [release notes][11] to learn more about this release.
