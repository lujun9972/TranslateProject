Microsoft Edge is Now One Step Closer to Full Release on Linux
======

Chromium-based Microsoft Edge was already available for Linux via the Dev channel. But, it was missing many features to start with.

Recently, Microsoft Edge for Linux has been getting essential feature additions that include the [Sign In &amp; Sync support][1] for Linux. And, now, Microsoft has finally released the beta version of the browser for Linux.

This also means that you will soon get to witness the stable release for Linux platform.

### Microsoft Edge for Linux: Beta Preview

While the dev channel was only suitable for testers and enthusiasts, the beta version should be technically more stable for public testing.

If you are someone who was waiting for the stable release to switch to Microsoft Edge, the beta version is your best bet to test things out before you are ready to ditch your current browser.

The beta release channel description mentions:

> The Beta channel is the most stable Microsoft Edge preview experience. With major updates, every 6 weeks, each release incorporates learnings and improvements from our Dev builds.

Of course, if you do not want another Chromium-browser as your option, that makes sense. But, having Microsoft Edge on Linux should also help Windows 10 users to choose Linux as their desktop choice when needed.

As of now, only the status of the Microsoft Edge browser has been updated to beta with no specific release notes addressing the change.

However, the browser received some [performance and bug fixes][3] a few days back. So, if you are interested to give it a spin, you can go ahead.

### Download Microsoft Edge for Linux

You will find both .Deb and .Rpm packages listed in the official download page for Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, etc.). It should be fairly easy to get it installed using the packages.

In either case, you can also find official installation instructions if you need the command-line.
