core improvements.
The Linux ecosystem houses quite a few Linux distros that can [turn your PC into a retro gaming console][1], and [Lakka][2] is one such option that will remind you of Kodi, the popular media player.

Lakka uses [LibreELEC][3] and [RetroArch][4] as its foundation to provide you with a lightweight and powerful system for your retro gaming needs. It has support for things such as multiplayer gaming ( _local_ / _internet_ ), wireless gamepads, and various small-board computers (SBCs).
