SnoopGod Linux: The Cybersecurity Distro Like Kali Linux
======
A modern fork of Blackbuntu for pentesters is here!
Linux distributions are aplenty, but only some can be categorized as the [best Linux distributions][1] for hacking and penetration testing. Among those, Kali Linux is the most popular one that has gained a cult following (for all the right reasons).

But, from time-to-time, we get to see new Linux distros that try to challenge the top dog with what they have to offer.

One such distro is the recently introduced “ **SnoopGod Linux** ” that has risen from the ashes of [Blackbuntu][2], a popular pentesting distro back in the day.

Strangely enough, when I first came across this on [Reddit][3], only one name came to my mind, and that was “[Snoop Dogg][4]”.

Maybe SnoopGod Linux's name was derived from the famous rapper's, perhaps not, who knows? Nonetheless, let's move on and see what SnoopGod, the Linux distro has to offer.

### SnoopGod Linux: Overview ⭐

![][5]

Built on an Ubuntu base, SnoopGod Linux **completely focuses on** [**pentesting**][6] **, security, and development**. At the time of writing, the latest release was based on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS, with KDE Plasma 5.24.7 as the [desktop environment][7] (DE), and [Linux kernel 6.5][8] powering it.

Some **key highlights** include:

  * **Intuitive User Interface**
  * **Security-Focused Approach**
  * **Expansive selection of Tools/Libraries**



Let's start off with the pre-installed set of tools and libraries that the developers say **consists of over 800 individual packages** to cover most pentesting use-cases with highlights such as [Aircrack-ng][9], [BeEF][10], [Metasploit][11], and more.

You can refer to [the list][12] for a detailed outlook of the tools and libraries included with SnoopGod Linux.

The homepage for SnoopGod Linux also mentions “ _designed with the aim of achieving the maximum performance and minimum consumption of resources_ ”.

As for the interface, I mentioned earlier that it features KDE Plasma, which, in my opinion, looks very neat, and **may be able to entice Windows users** into checking out SnoopGod Linux.

Overall, the package seems quite solid for a pentesting-focused Linux distro, and this pitches it right against [Exodia OS][14], which I checked out last year, and [Kali Linux][15], which is the de facto standard in this space.

If you try it out, please let me know how your experience was in the comments below. 💬

### 📥 Get SnoopGod Linux

For getting the latest SnoopGod Linux release, you can head over to its [official website][16], where you will find multiple builds; choose whichever suits your system best.

Before you go to install, just keep the **minimum system requirements** in mind:

  * **CPU:** 2 GHz dual-core processor.
  * **RAM:** 4 GB or more.
  * **Storage:** 80 GB or more.



I must say, that is a very steep number for the minimum required disk storage space, but I guess that is due to the sheer number of pre-installed packages it comes with. Anyhow, if you are interested in checking out the source code, then you can refer to its [GitHub repo][17].
