ArmSoM Unveils an Open-Source AI Module That Works With NVIDIA's Jetson Nano
======
An interesting new AI module with a board, aimed to offer compatibility
with the Jetson Nano interface.

[System-on-Module][3] (SoM) has proven to be useful in a wide variety of use cases, be it edge computing, cloud servers, or IoT devices.

These have also managed to get into the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), providing portable firepower to run AI models, and other related tasks.

[ArmSoM][4], a relatively new entrant in the SoM scene, one that has managed to [put the Raspberry Pi 5 to shame][5] with one of its recent launches, is now setting its sights on something new.

A few weeks earlier, they introduced a crowdfunding campaign for a new AI-focused SoM called the **ArmSoM RK3588 AI Module7** , which packs in some interesting hardware.

Let's take a closer look, shall we? 😃

### ArmSoM RK3588 AI Module7: What to Expect?

Engineered with workloads like edge computing, AI, VR/AR, and blockchain in mind, the [RK3588 AI Module7][7] is a compact SoM that is compatible with the [Jetson Nano][8] ecosystem.

When deployed, it can be used to carry out high-performance computing, be deployed into ultra-low power consumption HPC cluster nodes, process intensive ML/AI tasks, and more.

Some **key specs** include:

  * **CPU:** Quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 + Quad-core ARM Cortex-A55
  * **RAM:** 8 GB or 32 GB LPDDR4x @ 2112 MHZ
  * **GPU:** ARM Mali-G610 MP4
  * **NPU:** 6 TOPS



To further augment its capabilities, ArmSoM has also introduced the **AIM-IO board** , which can transform the RK3588 AI Module7 into a [single-board computer][9] (SBC). It takes design cues from the NVIDIA [Jetson Nano Developer Kit][10].

As you can see above, its port arrangement is a distinct reminder of the setup on the Jetson Nano Dev kit, with a familiar SODIMM-style edge connector in the center. ArmSoM mentions that they have also upgraded and improved the PCIe connectivity.

As for **the ports** on the AIM-IO board, there are:

  * 4x USB 3.0
  * 1x HDMI
  * 1x Display Port
  * 40-pin header
  * MIPI DSI/CSI



You can give the official [announcement blog][12] a read to learn more about these new devices.

#### 💰 Pricing and Availability

Currently, both the RK3588 AI Module7 and the AIM-IO board **are in the crowdfunding stage,** with ArmSoM stating that they will be making the firmware source and board schematics available as part of the crowdfunding campaign.

You can take a look at their [Crowd Supply][13] listing if you are interested in being an early contributor, making this a reality for the rest of the community.

Some useful, helpful comparisons pitching the RK3588 against the likes of the Raspberry Pi 5 and the Jetson Orin Nano can also be found on the same page.
