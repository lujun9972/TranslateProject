This Open-Source Android Weather App Looks Pretty!
======
A visually pleasing FOSS weather app. What more do you need!

There are endless possibilities to get weather data on your Android mobile. The most obvious one being — Google's weather notifications, which simply shows up even if you do not use it.

Of course, you can disable it, but what do you use as an alternative?

Countless options on the Play Store as well, but what if you want a free and open-source app without advertisements (or premium upgrades)?

Well, Breezy Weather is the one for you.

### Breezy Weather: Sleek UI and a Replacement to Others

![][3]

Breezy Weather is a free and open-source Android app that lets you replace all other weather applications.

By default, it relies on the open-source data source — [**Open-Meteo**][4].

But, it also supports other data sources like AccuWeather, if your location supports it, or the app detects it. Usually, you will be fine with the default source, as they mention that it is close to the data provided by AccuWeather.

Interestingly, if you want to choose a different source, you can try other flavors of the application, which should provide you with access to more sources.

And, this is a pretty powerful ability if you would like to customize your experience with the data source you trust. I believe you can manually use a different API for weather data (if you have access to any of it). I haven't tried it, so don't take my word for it.

In addition to this ability, you can expect these features:

  * **Customize the cards that you see on the main screen**
  * **Click on a specific date to see detailed weather information**
  * **Live wallpaper**
  * **Variety of widgets for homescreen**
  * **Dark mode**
  * **Forecasts for up to 16 days**
  * **Alternate calendars (like Indian National Calendar, Chinese Calendar)**
  * **Unit customization**

Furthermore, you get to control the refresh rate for the data to update in the background, and get it to automatically stop when the battery is low. That's a neat feature.

This is a must-have weather app if you are tired of getting advertisements, news, or premium subscription offers in your current weather app. And, of course, with open-source components by default, you get privacy as well.

### Install Breezy Weather

Breezy Weather is available on [F-Droid][6]. You can also install the APK directly from its [GitHub page][7].
