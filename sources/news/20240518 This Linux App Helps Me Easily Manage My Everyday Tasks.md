This Linux App Helps Me Easily Manage My Everyday Tasks
======
I think this is the perfect Linux app to help manage everyday tasks!
[![][1]][2]

There are certain times when I get overwhelmed and forget to carry out important tasks. That is when to-do apps come in handy for me.

In the past, I have come across many options, some of which I used regularly to keep things in check. But, I always keep an eye out for fresh ones that could help me manage my day-to-day tasks better.

One such option is **Planify** , which is an open-source to-do app for Linux. Join me as I explore this app while also trying to integrate my daily tasks into it.

### Planify: What Makes It Great?

![][3]

Being one of the [best to-do list apps][4] for Linux, Planify felt right at home when I first launched it. There was a familiar sidebar menu that housed the different categories of tasks, which were called projects in this case.

I created a few to handle my daily tasks; the project creation process was quite straightforward, with options to add emojis or color to them.

Task creation was also a breeze, with options like the ability to add a task description, labels, a priority flag, set a reminder, and even set them to reoccur at a set time.

Planify would also send notifications for tasks with a reminder; they generally popped up just a few seconds after the set time came up.

On my GNOME 42.9 system, the notifications only showed the name of the task, with the project name being displayed in the first line. I would have liked it if some task description lines had shown up with this.

I also liked the fact that **I could add sections** to a project. With that, I could neatly organize my high-priority tasks and my low-priority tasks into separate subsections.

The preferences' menu allowed me to customize things like which page to open on app launch, enable startup on system boot, tweak universal task settings, and switch between dark/light modes.

Also, did I mention that **Planify has support for syncing with Todoist**? I didn't get the chance to test it out, as I don't use that tool, but it is a good one for people who rely on [Todoist][8] as part of their workflow.

There's also **support for CalDAV** for those looking to configure Planify with other services, or self-hosted instances.

In the end, there's **not much to dislike about Planify** ; my experience using it was superb, and it will most likely replace my existing to-do app, [Errands][10].

Of course, that's just me. And, you might find some other app better for your workflow.

Just one thing that, I thought, was missing. A dedicated [pomodoro timer][11] that could have helped me stay focused on the task at hand, and I believe adding something like that would complete Planify.

If you found Planify interesting, then you could get it from the [Flathub store][12] or the [Snap store][13]. For the source code, you can visit its [GitHub][14] repo.
