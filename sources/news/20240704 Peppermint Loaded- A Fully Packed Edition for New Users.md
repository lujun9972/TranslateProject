Peppermint Loaded: A Fully Packed Edition for New Users
======
A new edition for Peppermint OS users!
[![][1]][2]

Peppermint OS can be regarded as one of the [most lightweight Linux distros][3] around, with a relatively minimal storage footprint, when compared to other more weighty distributions like Fedora or Ubuntu.

Back in 2023, the developers had launched a more compact release under the [Peppermint OS Mini][4] name, which was available in 32-bit/64-bit builds with both Debian and Devuan bases.

In contrast to that, they have now gone to the opposite end of the spectrum to offer a new “ _fully loaded_ ” variant of Peppermint OS, which doesn't hold back when it comes to the storage size.

Let's check it out. 😃

### Peppermint OS Loaded: What to Expect?

![][5]

Responding to many requests from users, the developers have introduced this variant for providing **a pre-configured option that will make life easier for new users** , giving them a solid out-of-the-box experience.

To accomplish that, they have **put in many new applications and tools** , which include the likes of Inkscape, LibreOffice, Firefox, GIMP, Thunderbird, Timeshift, GNOME System Tools, and Atril.

Furthermore, to make the deal even sweeter, there's **pre-configured Flatpak support** ( _not on 32-bit systems_ ) that allows users to take advantage of a wide array of applications, and there are pre-installed utilities like Btop++, pfetch, and xDaily too.

You can learn more about this release by going through the [announcement blog][6] and [build logs][7].

### 📥 Get Peppermint OS Loaded

If this release piqued your interest, then you can grab it from the [official website][8], where other ISOs such as the flagship, community, and mini are also available.

Scroll down to the “ _Peppermint OS Fully Loaded_ ” section, where you get to choose between 32-bit/64-bit variants of either a Debian or Devuan base.
