Share Passwords Securely With Proton Pass's New 'Secure Link' Feature
======
Proton Pass, adding more features to its arsenal.

Among the privacy-conscious, Proton is a very well-known name, thanks to their wide range of products and services that make it a major player in the space.

And, as it stands, they are not slowing down in 2024. After the recent launch of [Docs in Proton Drive][3], and the earlier [acquisition][4] of Standard Notes, they have introduced yet another new feature for an existing service.

Let's check it out. 😃

### Secure Password Sharing in Proton Pass

In a bid to facilitate secure and effortless sharing of passwords for users, **Proton has introduced Secure Links in Proton Pass for users of the paid plans** ( _Plus and above_ ).

With this, users now don't have to share their passwords with other people in insecure ways, like over a text or mail. When using Secure Links, **users can share an auto-expiring encrypted link that is generated on their device** , with Proton's server never fully seeing the URL.

Only the recipient can see the contents of it, with the sender having **a great deal of control over the link**. Using the Proton Pass app ( _Web and Mobile_ ), they can set an expiry period ( _1 hour-30 days_ ), limit how many times it can be viewed, and, of course, revoke access to it.

The app will also show users any past expired links, so they can easily track them. During the launch, [Son Nguyen][6], Product Lead for Proton Pass, added that:

> At Proton Pass, our goal is to equip users with all the necessary tools for robust security. With Secure Links, sharing passwords becomes as easy as sending a link, without sacrificing security.

> Combined with vault sharing, Proton Pass not only enhances user security but also streamlines the user experience, thereby boosting productivity.

To complement this new addition, the developers have also included **a new “Extra Password” function** ( _accessible from the settings_ ), that allows users to add another password for Proton Pass, alongside their existing Proton Account password for compartmentalizing their data further.

If you would like to go more in-depth into this, then [announcement blog][7] is a must-read.
