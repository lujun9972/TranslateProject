A Paid Open-Source Android App for Cloud Storage Security
======
Paying a premium is not always a bad thing.
**If it is not encrypted, it is not safe.** I have been swearing by this rule recently, and it is not easy. Sometimes encrypting stuff adds inconvenience, and sometimes it doesn't.

I apply the same rule for storing important files on the cloud ☁️

Cloud storage service providers promise/claim to protect our files. And, I am sure, most of the [cloud storage services][1] do a good job at it. However, not all of them offer **end-to-end encryption (or client-side encryption)** which makes sure that your data stays safe/private to you even if there is unauthorized access to your data.

You can fix that using a powerful open-source tool called **Cryptomator**.

### Cryptomator: Encrypt Easily and Send it to the Cloud

![][2]

Cryptomator is an open-source tool that lets you encrypt files locally before you upload them to the cloud. It is a decently popular option among desktop users, **available for free to Linux/Windows/macOS users.**

All you need to do is — **create a vault, set a master password, and start adding files to it that you want encrypted.**

The good news is: **Cryptomator is also available for Android (and iOS)**. So, you can do the heavy lifting work on-the-go, encrypt your files, and upload them to the cloud.

It sounds impressive, doesn't it?

The only catch is: you need to purchase a license key to use Cryptomator on Android. **It is a one-time fee ($16).**

📋

The developers mention that they charge users for technical differences in mobile platforms, and the constraints put by Google Play Store/App Store policies.

No matter what, I feel like — any user who is serious about encrypting files on-the-go before uploading them to the cloud, **should not hesitate to pay the one-time fee**. After all, purchasing a license would help the product, right? 😼

And, that is the same reason I chose to purchase a license to use Cryptomator on Android.

To get started with the app, you need to click on the " **+** " icon to add a vault, and then pick the location of the vault. It can be a **cloud storage service, a WebDAV/S3 storage, or your Android phone's local storage.**

Once you choose/sign in to a cloud storage, you need to:

  * **Create a folder and choose a path to store it at**
  * **Set a password**
  * **Start adding files**



💡

Create a strong master password with a combination of uppercase/lowercase alphabets, special characters like &$@#, and numbers.

Once you do that, write it down on a paper to keep it safe. You can choose to store it using one of the best [open-source password managers][3], but I do not recommend that.

If you want to use Cryptomator to encrypt your photos/videos automatically, you can also do that by activating the auto-upload feature. In addition to that, you get a couple of tweaks to enhance your experience searching and **locking your vault (using biometrics)**.

As you can notice in the screenshot above, the unlocked vaults get locked after a minute by default, you can tweak it ( _or set it to never, which is a bad idea_ ).

### Download Cryptomator Now!

Cryptomator is one of my favorite open-source tools, and it makes things much easier (and safer) on my smartphone.

It is available to purchase on [Google Play Store][5], [F-Droid][6], or get the APK from [the official website][7].

[Cryptomator (Play Store)][5]

There are some technical limitations for the F-Droid variant (like unavailability of certain cloud services). You can check the details on the official website linked.

And, if you are wondering, Cryptomato's upcoming Android release v **1.10.1** is expected in a couple of weeks, as per my communication with them.

💬 _What do you think of Cryptomator? Did you know about this tool? Do you use something else for your mobile?_
