StartMail Finally Launches Business Plans to Take on Google and Proton Mail
======
StartMail arrives for small businesses.
[![][1]][2]

We have been seeing a growing trend of privacy conscious people switching to [secure email services][3] to escape the clutches of Big Tech, who are relentless in harvesting every bit of data they can find on their users.

Many have settled for services like [Proton Mail][4] and [Tuta][5] who have free plans, but their products keep privacy at the forefront, unlike the likes of Google and Microsoft.

This nature is also what attracts many business customers to their services, who don't want Big Tech's data-mining hands in their operations.

[StartMail][6] is another solid email service from the founder of the privacy-focused search engine **Startpage** , and they never had a dedicated business offering that organizations could use to manage a crucial part of their online identity.

Luckily, that's changing now. 👇

### A Practical Option For Businesses
