Fractal 8 Released: The Linux Matrix Messaging App Gets Better!
======
A new upgrade has landed for Matrix users!
[![][1]][2]

Fractal is undoubtedly one of the [best Matrix clients for decentralized messaging][3] around. Even though it's tailored for the GNOME desktop environment, its features and portability ensure that it can be used on most popular Linux distros comfortably.

Did I mention it's [Rust][4]-based?

Well, its developers have recently introduced a new release that features some important quality-of-life upgrades.

Let's take a look without further ado. 😃

## 🆕 Fractal 8: What's New?

![][5]

We start off with the upgrades to drafts. **Unsent typed messages are now stored separately, on a room-by-room basis** , and are not lost on application restart. The latter was made possible by due to tweaks in the database code.

Similarly, there is now support for authenticated media, **improvements to the mention behavior (sent intentionally)** , fixes for the history media viewers, a new banner that shows up when synchronization with a homeserver fails, and a streamlined verification and account recovery process.

The developers have also brought about **persistence for collapsed categories in the sidebar** across application/system restarts, with the “ _Historical_ ” category being collapsed by default.

Additionally, they have implemented more robust HTML rendering, and **code blocks now have support for syntax highlighting**. Lists also see some useful refinements, with those now having the ability to be nested, and numbered lists being able to start with a random number.

## 📥 Download Fractal 8

The most straightforward way to get this release of Fractal is by getting it from the [Flathub store][6]. If you are interested in the source code, then head to its [GitLab][7] repo.
