AI-Powered Nextcloud Hub 8 Is Here With Benefits for the Public Sector!
======
The Swiss army knife of collaboration tools gets cooler features, and AI
abilities.
[Nextcloud][1] is an open-source collaboration platform that has grown rapidly in the past few years, with it now boasting **over 20 million users across the globe** who are taking advantage of its flagship product, **** Nextcloud Hub.

During the [Enterprise Day 2024][2] event, Nextcloud introduced their latest developmental leap, **Nextcloud Hub 8** , which, alongside improvements for private users, also focuses on providing many benefits tailored specifically for the [public sector][3].

So, what are you waiting for? Let's dive right in! ü§ì

### Nextcloud Hub 8: Scaling New Heights?

We start off with the [BITV 2.0][4] certification that Nextcloud Hub now has. It is a set of guidelines for barrier-free design of websites, applications, and other kinds of IT solutions that **makes Nextcloud Hub 8 highly accessible for people with any kind of impairment or disability**.

As this is a massive release, we will be focusing on the following **key highlights** :

  * **Improved Collaboration**
  * **Refined Nextcloud Office**
  * **Upgraded Files, Mail and Calendar**
  * **Introduction of Nextcloud Assistant 2.0**



#### Improved Collaboration

![Nextcloud Teams][5]

Building upon [Circles][6], we now have **Nextcloud Teams** , which offers a redesigned team overview screen and easy access to shared team resources such as Talk rooms and [Collectives][7].

There's also a dashboard widget to make things easier, and it is now **more straightforward to share links and other content with Collectives** ; **** no need to jump through hoops like before.

![Talk Message Editing][8]

[Talk][9], the communication component in Nextcloud Hub, has also received plenty of care. Users **can now edit messages up to 6 hours after a message was sent** , avoiding any awkward situations caused by typos.

![Talk Federated Chatting][10]

The developers have also introduced **Federated Chatting** , where team members across the federated talk instances can communicate with each other, with many ( _but not all_ ) Talk features being available.

That was made possible with the use of [OpenCloudMesh][11] ( _OCM_ ), developed at CERN in collaboration with Nextcloud and a few other open-source projects.

#### Refined Nextcloud Office

![Nextcloud Spreadsheets][12]

Moving on over to the office suite side of Nextcloud Hub, we have the newly added ability to **link spreadsheets with forms to automatically collect submitted data** in formats like _CSV_ , _XLSX_ , and _ODS_.

Then there's the new ‚Äú _ **Cell Protection**_ ‚Äù feature, which ensures that no unwanted changes are made to protected cells without authorization, **improved filtering** with the _AutoFilter_ feature, and **new filtering options** like _Color_ and _Condition_.

For [Documents][13], now the layouts can be managed more easily with the help of **dedicated section editing** , **separate headers/footers** for pages under the same style, **support for _STYLEREF_ fields**, and more.

#### Upgraded Files, Mail and Calendar

![Nextcloud Files][14]

[Files][15] sees an upgrade with a new ‚Äú _Personal Files_ ‚Äù section that contains all the files and folders uploaded by a user to a Nextcloud Hub instance. Sharing files or folders is also easier and more secure now, thanks to **one-time-use links** and **QR codes**.

![Nextcloud Mail][16]

Similarly, [Mail][17] has also improved, with **IMAP accounts without the _CONDSTORE_ extension syncing faster** than before, **stacking for the message list and reading pane** , **full-width message lists** , **iCloud compatibility** , and more.

![Calendar's Revamped Event Window][18]

The [Calendar][19] sees **a revamped event window** that is meant to be more intuitive than before, with a user-friendly layout, and two window modes: ‚Äú _View_ ‚Äù and ‚Äú _Edit_ ‚Äù.

#### Introducing Nextcloud Assistant 2.0

![Nextcloud Assistant 2.0][20]

To complete the package, we have [Nextcloud Assistant 2.0][21], which is **the de facto centerpiece of the Nextcloud Hub 8 release**.

Developed in collaboration with **many public sector partners** , this was built keeping [data sovereignty][22] in mind and focuses on being an in-premise/regionally hosted AI tool.

Among the public sector partners, the German state of [Schleswig-Holstein][23] played a key role in this, which was recently in the news for [ditching Microsoft][24] in favor of open-source software such as _Linux_ and _LibreOffice_.

Nextcloud Assistant 2.0 has [context awareness][25] that allows it to access your Files and **answer questions related to a wide range of things** , starting from documentation, contracts, and reports, all the way to how you could reply to an email.

It is tightly integrated with Nextcloud Hub that you can use it **to create pieces of text to reflect your writing style** , **create summaries of meetings/emails/chats** , **automate events in the Calendar** , **recommend resources** , and even **translate foreign languages**.

Another great thing is that **Nextcloud Assistant 2.0 is also available on mobile**!

Overall, Nextcloud Hub is a considerable upgrade, I recommend you go through the official [announcement blog][26] to dive deeper into this release.
