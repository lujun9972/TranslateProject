Garuda Linux's Big Release, Code-named “Bird of Prey” is Here!
======
Garuda Linux with KDE Plasma 6, a new browser, and several nice
upgrades!
Many users who are looking for a [user-friendly Arch-based Linux distribution][1] usually end up with a distro like [Garuda Linux][2], and I mean, who can blame them? Garuda Linux is so cool!

Last month, the project [turned 4][3], marking a major milestone for the vibrant distro. But that's not all. We now have a new Garuda Linux release that has been given the codename “ **Bird of Prey** ”, derived not from Harley Quinn's [escapades][4], but from the [actual birds][5] that hunt other vertebrates.

Let's fly into this release and check out what's on offer 🕊️

## 🆕 Garuda Linux “Bird of Prey”: What's New?

![][6]

Compared to its [previous release][7], Garuda Linux's first release of 2024 has some important things to bring to the table. It is powered by [Linux kernel 6.8][8] and features the following **key highlights** :

  * **FireDragon's Floorp Connection**
  * **Desktop Environment Upgrades**
  * **New Wallpapers**



### FireDragon's Floorp Connection

![][9]

Starting with this release, Garuda Linux's web browser, FireDragon, now uses the popular Firefox fork, [Floorp][10] as a strong base to build on, ditching [Librewolf][11] in the process.

During the testing phase for this, many community members came together to report bugs, which were fixed before the release. FireDragon now also has many improvements, like **faster webpage loading** , **revamped branding** , **a customizable sidebar** , **rounded page corners** , and more.

We have covered the underlying Floorp browser separately, if you are curious:

### Desktop Environment Upgrades

This release features upgraded desktop environments with fixes and improvements across the board.

**Starting with** [**Hyprland**][13], Garuda Linux comes with a special variant called _G-Hyprland_ that has additional capabilities like the ability to tweak the blurring of windows, change the corner size/gap of windows, and new waybar themes.

Moreover, you also get support for custom static/animated wallpapers, and a slideshow option for wallpapers.

Then, on **the KDE Plasma-equipped _Dr460nized_ side**, many plasmoids were ported to Plasma 6, initial HDR support is being offered, and **Wayland is now the default session**.

The _Garuda System Maintenance_ tool was also updated, allowing users to upgrade from Plasma 5 _Dr460nized_ to [Plasma 6][14].

**For** [**Sway**][15], in a bid to improve the log in experience, [ReGreet][16] was introduced. Then, we have the screenshot tool which was changed to [Swappy][17], the clipboard manager was changed to [Cliphist][18], and a new cheat sheet that was added for easy understanding of key bindings.

The default terminal emulator and app launcher also sees a change, with [Foot][19] and [Fuzzel][20] now taking over those tasks.

### New Wallpapers

![][21]

You also get some neat wallpapers with this release. There are **three new wallpapers** that were chosen from the [wallpaper contest][22]. The one you have been seeing throughout this article is called “Rave” by [_Mior_D_Miro_][23] _._

The other two runner-ups were “Garuda Bird of Prey (4)” by [_mr_maniac_2k_][24], and “Garuda SpaceBird” by [elite][25].

Surprisingly, the Garuda Linux build I checked out didn't feature the runner-ups I mentioned earlier, but only the “Rave” one.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

Apart from the highlights of this release, here are some other changes:

  * Continuation of the infrastructure upgrade work.
  * Dropping of the Qtile edition as the maintainer had to shift their focus.
  * A few updates to the slides shown during install, for a more modern look and feel.
  * ISO images are now automatically verified during boot and will prevent booting if there are any issues.



There are a few other changes that are not mentioned above. You can go through the [release blog][26] or the [official changelogs][27] to learn about those.

## 📥 Download Garuda Linux “Bird of Prey”

You can get this release on any of the **nine editions** ( _yes, you read that correctly_ ) of Garuda Linux from the [official website][28].
