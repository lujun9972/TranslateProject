Mastodon has been one of the [most popular][3] alternatives to X in the past few years, with many making the jump to socialize with a more friendly crowd, according to their personal preferences.

Sure, it has not become mainstream, but people now have many choices to explore the [Fediverse][4], where's the harm in that?

Anyhow, those interested in further improving their Fediverse/Mastodon experience can take advantage of this really cool open-source desktop client for Linux.

Continue reading to find out more! 😃

### Tuba: Overview ⭐

![][5]

Developed by a group of dedicated developers, [Tuba][6] is a fork of the now defunct Mastodon client, [Tootle][7], that is powered by the [Vala][8] programming language.

It has been made available under the [GPL-3.0 License][9], and is actively maintained, with patches flowing in every other week.

Some **key features** of it include:

  * **Quick Setup**
  * **Mobile-Friendly**
  * **Intuitive User Interface**



#### Initial Impressions 👨‍💻

Installation went by smoothly on my Ubuntu-equipped laptop, and on first launch, I had to enter the server URL of my Mastodon account before I could proceed.

📋

There was also an option to enable “ _ _Admin Mode__ ” for users who need access to the Admin dashboard.

When I went ahead, a webpage popped up asking me to log in with my account, which was hosted on [Fosstodon][11]. I would have liked if there was a handy list of [popular instances][12] somewhere on the onboarding page for Tuba, but, it's okay.

![][13]

On the webpage, I authorized Tuba to the permissions shown above. Without those permissions, the app will not work.

After that was done, I was taken into the “ **Home** ” feed, where I could see posts from the people and organizations I follow, it was identical to what one would find when using a web browser, albeit with some neat tweaks.

![][14]

I then moved to the “ **Notifications** ” section, where my most recent notifications were shown to me, arranged neatly. I could also filter the notifications to sort them, the option for that was the funnel logo at the top-right of the app.

![][15]

After that, I went into the “ **Conversations** ” tab, where I was able to see an old private mention I did on a post by [stux][16] back in 2021. This is the place where you will find such posts.

_If you haven't figured by now, I am a bit dormant on my Fosstodon account._ 😝

![I said what I said ☠️][17]

Then came the “ **Search** ” section, which was the one-stop place to search for people, posts, and hashtags.

As you can see below, I searched for [Nick][18], from The Linux Experiment, and I was able to find two accounts, with the one on mastodon.social being the official one.

![][19]

I then moved on to the “ **Explore** ” tab, which featured multiple sub-categories, in the first one called “ _Posts_ ”, there was a random feed of suggested posts that covered various topics, including U.S. politics.

On the second one, “ _Hashtags_ ”, there was a list of trending hashtags across the Fediverse, on the third one, “ _News_ ”, there was a mix of different news articles, and on the last one, “ _For You_ ”, I was shown a few suggested accounts to follow.

![The various sections under “Explore”][20]

All this left me wondering, **how can I view my profile?**

For that, I went into the hamburger menu at the top left of Tuba, where there was an option to “ _Open Profile_ ”, it also had other helpful options such as to see follow requests, muted/blocked accounts, keyboard shortcuts and more.

There was also the option to add/remove profiles in the accounts' menu where It was weird to see that if I clicked on my name in it, the home feed would load up, instead of my profile.

But, when I click on the profile picture, Tuba would load my profile.

![Add account and other options of Tuba][21]

If you were wondering how a profile looks when using Tuba, this is how. 👇

![][22]

I then tried out the **post editor** , which can be accessed in various ways, such as from the hamburger menu, by clicking on the pen logo at the bottom-right when browsing the home feed, or by replying to a post.

![][23]

It was quite straightforward to get used to, with options for changing post visibility, adding media, creating a poll, adding emojis, changing the language, and placing a content warning.

![][24]

Similarly, the **preferences menu** had many options to tweak Tuba to my liking, but the default experience was good enough for me. There is a host of accessibility, notification, and filtering options under this.

Wrapping up, I will say that **using Tuba was a great experience** , and folks who want a native client experience should definitely go with it, the storage footprint is quite low too!

### 📥 Get Tuba

If you liked Tuba, or just want to take it for a test drive, then you can do so by getting it from the [Flathub store][25].
