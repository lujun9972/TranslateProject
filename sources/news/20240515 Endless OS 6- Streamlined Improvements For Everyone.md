Endless OS 6: Streamlined Improvements For Everyone
======
Much-needed enhancements for a better education experience.
[Endless OS][1] is a distro that focuses on promoting education and productivity, while also being accessible to a wide variety of users. It prides itself on providing a user-friendly experience that is intuitive.

In a recent announcement, the developers have introduced **Endless OS 6** , which comes more than a year after the [previous release][2].

Let's check it out! 😀

## 🆕 Endless OS 6: What's New?

Based on the [Debian 12.5 “Bookworm”][3] release, Endless OS 6 is powered by the robust [Linux kernel 6.5][4] and features the [GNOME 43.9][5] desktop environment to give users a sleek user interface.

Some **key highlights** of this release include:

  * **Dark Mode**
  * **New Wallpapers**
  * **Updated Application Suite**



### Dark Mode

![][6]

Endless OS now finally features support for Dark Mode. This much-needed feature will make it easy on the eyes for people who work in the dark, or people like me who always have Dark Mode enabled. 😛

When this mode is enabled, all the apps that support Dark Mode should also switch to their respective dark versions without the need for intervention by the user.

### New Wallpapers

![][7]

To go along with the newly introduced Dark Mode functionality, there are **two new default wallpapers**. Technically, they are the same ones, but one is a light variant, and the other is a dark variant that follows whichever appearance setting ( _light/dark_ ) is being used.

These were designed by [Joana Filizola][8], a product designer at the Endless OS Foundation. She used [Midjourney][9] in the initial stages of design to create her version of a digital mountain with never-ending orange hues.

### Updated Application Suite

![][10]

Many core apps included with Endless OS have been updated, with the [Music][11] app being included for large music libraries and the [Decibels][12] app for listening to single audio files ([ _first look_][13] _coming soon_ ).

The Image Viewer ( _formerly known as_ [_Loupe_][14]) has also been updated, with it now providing better performance, support for HEIC/HEIF and WebP, a cleaner interface, and more.

![][15]

There is also GNOME's [Screenshot tool][16] that allows you to take screenshots and screen recordings with ease. Just use the _PrtScn_ button on your keyboard or search for the term “ _Screenshot_ ” in the app launcher to get started with this.

If you were to opt for the full version of Endless OS 6, then you could take advantage of the many **pre-installed tools that are useful for game development** such as Godot, GDevelop, Blender, Audacity, GIMP, Inkscape, TurtleBlocks, Scratch, and Pixelorama.

With the full version, you also get access to **many educational games** such as Dragon's Apprentice, Fablemaker, Frog Squash, The Passage, Tank Warriors, and Aqueducts.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

Other than the highlights of this release, we have a few miscellaneous changes:

  * Better low memory management.
  * Removal of [Intel RST][17] Optane storage support.
  * Inclusion of [PipeWire 1.0][18] for handling audio/video tasks.
  * An up-to-date version of [Toolbx][19], existing containers created on older versions of Endless OS won't start with this.



The [announcement blog][20] has a few more details if you are interested in learning further about this release.

## 📥 Get Endless OS 6

You can download either the basic ISO, which is compact, and ships with basic tools/utilities. Or, you could opt for the gigantic Full ISO, which comes preloaded with many tools, apps, games, and even an encyclopedia.
