Fedora Approves a New Spin With Miracle Window Manager
======
A new spin with an interesting window manager.

Window managers on Linux make it easier for you to use multiple windows when working on your computer. They also let you customize the look and feel of the distro.

On the other hand, there are many instances where we get to see a window manager having a Linux distro spin of its own, with Fedora's official [spin lineup][3] housing many cool ones such as Fedora Sway and Fedora i3. Those are some of the [best window managers][4] around.

But, with a recent vote, Fedora has adopted a new “ **Miracle** ” spin to their lineup that ought to pique your interest. So, allow me to take you through this.

### What Kind of Miracles Can You Expect?

[Proposed][7] almost a month ago, a new spin featuring the Miracle Window Manager has been approved by the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo), who took a vote on it.

The vote [passed][8] with five in favor and zero not in favor. If you were not familiar, [Miracle WM][9] is an under-development window manager based on [Mir][10], Canonical's Wayland compositor.

Even though its [first release][11] was just a few months before, Miracle seems to be progressing rather nicely. When Liam from The Register [checked it out][12], he found it to be incomplete. But that's expected. It is still under heavy development, after all.

Some of its **key features** include:

  * **User Friendly**
  * **Smooth Animations**
  * **Native Wayland Support**



All in all, I am excited to see a new Fedora spin, that too with an upcoming exciting window manager. Though I am not sure when we will get to see the earliest Fedora 41 images equipped with it. A few weeks is a reasonable guess.

_💬 What about you? Are you looking forward to this?_
