This Open-Source Android Podcast App is What You Need in 2024
======
A neat podcast manager app.

Podcasts are back in the trend. Whether you are watching YouTube, listening to Spotify or any other platform, chances are, you will come across a podcast. And, with all that, sometimes, the content being consumed can be too diversified (or confusing).

So, if you can have a dedicated podcast app (along with the bonus that it is open-source), will you not be interested in giving it a try?

I highlight AntennaPod as the go-to open-source podcast app that you should have on your Android device. You get to keep up with your podcast, and take control of your privacy at the same time.

### AntennaPod: A Private Experience for Podcasts

![][3]

AntennaPod does not require you to sign up to listen. You can manage the podcasts without providing any personal information.

It gives you the optional ability to back up podcast subscriptions using an external integration, _gPodder.net_ or export a local OPML copy.

AntennaPod also lets you import subscriptions using the .opml file, Apple database file or RSS feed URLs.

Recently, countless users exported their Google Podcast subscriptions (as Google decided to kill the app) to switch away to another podcast app. If you are in the same boat, you can try importing them to AntennaPod if you did not know about this app.

The app provides a straightforward experience, but comes with a useful set of customization options.

You can download the podcasts, subscribe to particular feeds, discover new podcasts (suggestions powered by Apple Podcasts), rename podcasts for convenience, and more.

Some features include:

  * Ability to filter subscriptions as per duration
  * Toggle episode covers
  * Tweak playback settings for skip intervals and queue
  * Download management (auto-download / auto-delete)
  * Synchronization using gPodder or Nextcloud app
  * Import/Export subscriptions and queues
  * Add favorites



In addition, AntennaPod also gives you the ability to set a sleep timer, so it stops the podcasts automatically.

The overall user experience is incredibly fast, with no fancy animations dimming down the performance.

I used the app to listen to a couple of podcasts, the quality of the audio stream was good. And, it was a sleek experience, with no shortcomings that I could find.

### Download AntennaPod Now!

It is available to download on [Google Play Store][4] and [F-Droid][5]. You can also get the APK from its [GitHub page][6].
