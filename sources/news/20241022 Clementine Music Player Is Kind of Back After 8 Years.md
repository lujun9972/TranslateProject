Clementine Music Player Is Kind of Back After 8 Years!
======
If you are a fan of Celementine music player, there's some news for you!
[![][1]][2]

Finding [good music players on Linux][3] is not that difficult. There are many great options, like Rhythmbox, VLC, Amberol, [Audacious][4], cmus, and more that usually fit most people's use cases and preferences.

Even with the rise of [music streaming services][5], offline-first apps like these are a great reminder of the past, when you could physically own media without the fear of losing access to it because a publisher went bankrupt.

Now, it seems Clementine Music Player, a well-known name in the FOSS player space, has come back from the dead, just before [Día de Muertos][6], to show that it is not going anywhere.

I spotted this [thanks to Joey][7], who noticed there was a new non-RC release for it after over 8 years ( _the last one was in April 2016_ ).

So, let's check it out! 😃

### Clementine Music Player Returns

![][8]

Clementine Music Player is a C++-based open-source music player that takes inspiration from Amarok, another popular FOSS offering. With the new 1.4.1 release, Clementine has broken its very long streak of pushing out [RC releases][9].

Interestingly, the changelog for this release says, “ _Rolling releases_ ”, which means that this is still not a new stable release; however, it is not a preview release either and features some important fixes.

There are tweaks like the Wikipedia plugin being updated, an option to hide the sidebar, a new search filter for the playlist page, the library showing Album Artist/Album by default, and the block analyzer being revamped to boost performance.

Even though these changes were a part of earlier preview builds (RC), they are still worth noting. You should also know that **Clementine has been ported to Qt 5**.

### Get Clementine Music Player

You can get the latest release from the GitHub [releases section][10] of the project's repo. If you are interested in contributing or just want to build from source, then the source code is [freely available][11] under GPL 3.0.
