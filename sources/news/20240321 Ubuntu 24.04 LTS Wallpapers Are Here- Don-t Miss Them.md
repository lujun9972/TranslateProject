Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Wallpapers Are Here: Don't Miss Them!
======
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS collection, looks pretty!
We already know that Ubuntu 24.04 LTS will be a [feature-packed release][1] that will take the popular Debian-based distro into a new era of desktop Linux.

Recently, [Canonical][2] announced a set of default wallpapers that will be used in the upcoming release, with both official and community offerings. Let's take a brief look at them.

### A Collection of Noble Wallpapers

![Official Ubuntu 24.04 Mascot Wallpapers][4]

The Ubuntu 24.04 release takes its codename “Noble Numbat” from an endangered species of insectivorous marsupial, [Numbat][5], whose diet consists mostly of munching on termites.

According to Canonical, the “Noble” part comes from their black/white striped backs that are similar to a kingly robe, and also because they are the animal emblem for the state of [Western Australia][6].

That shows in the **four official mascot wallpapers** that depict two Numbats sat over a crown with their faces towards the center and their tongues out.

The ones you see above are the more colorful/dark ones, which I assume to be the light/dark versions of the same wallpaper.

There are two lighter-colored variants of the same too; with gray and white color tones that also look neat, in my opinion. They also showcased a few blank wallpapers which didn't have anything in the background, just a few different color tones.

**But, wait, there's more! ✋ 👀**

![Ubuntu 24.04 Community Wallpapers][8]

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS “Noble Numbat” **also features community wallpapers** chosen from the latest Ubuntu [Wallpaper Competition][9], which always happens before a major release.

The winning entries shown above/below were the work of contributors, [_amaral_][10], [_azskalt_][11], [_orbitelambda_][12], [_mizuno-as_][13], [_audioaddict_][14], and [_moka-hun_][15]. They, and the others, had to submit their work in any of the four categories set out by Canonical.

📋

The categories were ****Mascot Theme**** , ****Digital/Abstract Art**** , ****Nature**** , and ****Other**** with no AI-generated content being allowed.

However, among the community wallpapers, **the above two caught my eye** , the left one has a Numbat looking up towards the Sun (I presume) created using [Krita][17] by _azskalt_. The other one reminded me of my escapades in [Red Dead Redemption 2][18], with a very wild west feel to it; created by _orbitelambda_.

### Want to check them out?

You can download the official Noble Numbat wallpapers from the [Google Drive][19] link Canonical have provided, and for more details on how they got around to naming this LTS release of Ubuntu, you can refer to the [announcement blog][20].
