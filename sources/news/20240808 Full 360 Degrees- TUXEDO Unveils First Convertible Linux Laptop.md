Full 360 Degrees! TUXEDO Unveils First Convertible Linux Laptop
======
TUXEDO Computers attempt at presenting a convertible Linux laptop.
Here's what it features.

Hardware built with Linux in mind is a rare, but increasingly popular sight in today's time, where we have some really cool folks crafting purpose-built Linux hardware such as [System76][3], [Slimbook][4], and [Star Labs][5].

On the more mainstream side of things, we already know that Qualcomm is working on [readying up support][6] for Linux on their Snapdragon X Elite platform.

However, just a few months back, [TUXEDO Computers][7], revealed that they were [working on][8] a Snapdragon X Elite-powered laptop that's expected to be released around the end of this year or later.

But, before that comes around, they have launched a new **3-in-1 convertible Linux laptop** called the ‚Äú **InfinityFlex 14** ‚Äù that's pushing the boundaries of ‚Äú _flexible working_ ‚Äù.

### TUXEDO InfinityFlex 14: Productivity Turbocharged

![][9]

Dubbed by its creators as having ‚Äú _the twist_ ‚Äù, and for having ‚Äú _almost infinite_ ‚Äù operation modes. At first glance, the TUXEDO InfinityFlex 14 **seems to be a great fit for working professionals** , more so if they are into a more creative line of work.

Some **key specs** of this Laptop include:

  * **CPU:** [Intel Core i5-1335U][10]
  * **RAM:** 2x 8 GB @3200 MHZ
  * **Connectivity:** 4G (LTE-A/LTE+) & Wi-Fi.
  * **Power:** A portable 100 W USB-C power supply. (250 g/8.8 oz)
  * **Battery:** 55 Wh, with a claimed 6 hour runtime on local video playback.
  * **Display:** 14‚Ä≥ touchscreen with 100% sRGB color gamut and a resolution of 1920√ó1200 @60 Hz with 400 nits of maximum brightness.



#### üì¶ What's In The Box?

![][11]

Enclosed in a sleek-looking shell, TUXEDO has gone with **a silver-colored aluminum material** for the lid and bottom part of the laptop to ensure durability. For the other bits, my best guess is that they used hard plastics.

Thanks to all that, the InfinityFlex 14 comes in at **a manageable 1.5 Kg weight** , and the dimensions of the laptop are quite accessible too at 31.6√ó22.9 cm ( _12.4√ó9‚Ä≥_ ) and less than 2 cm ( _0.7‚Ä≥_ ) in height when the lid is locked in place.

The main highlight of this laptop's design is the robust **double hinge design** that allows the InfinityFlex 14 to be so flexible ( _pun intended)_.

You could use it as a laptop, as a touch display when the lid is pushed back a bit, or as a tablet when the lid is completely flat on the laptop's bottom surface.

When using the InfinityFlex 14 as a touch display or tablet, **the keyboard and trackpad will be automatically deactivated** to prevent any erroneous inputs, and the screen is rotated according to the orientation of the device.

As for the keyboard, it is compact, with a white backlight, and the touchpad is a 13.5√ó7.7 cm ( _5.3√ó3‚Ä≥_ ) glass one with integrated mouse buttons, which should be noticeably better than a plastic one.

If you were wondering **what ports it has** , well, it has many:

  * 1x HDM 2.0 Port
  * 2x USB-A Port
  * Card Reader for microSD or SIM card.
  * 1x 3.5 mm 2-in-1 headphone/microphone jack.
  * 2x USB-C, with one being Thunderbolt 4, the other being USB-C 3.2 Gen 2.



There's also **support for pens** (stylus) using the MPP 2.0 standard with 4096 pressure levels. TUXEDO already lists a Wacom one in [their store][13], but they are working on two in-house models that will be out soon.

To wrap this up, **users can upgrade/replace the RAM** by using the two SO-DIMM slots which support up to 64 GB of RAM @3200 MHZ and **expand their storage** by making use of the two M.2 slots for SSDs.

### üí∏ Availability and Pricing

You can pre-order the InfinityFlex 14 from the [official store][14], with deliveries starting sometime around the middle of September.

The base configuration with an Intel Core i5-1335U, 2x 8 GB 3200 MHz DDR4 RAM, a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD running [TUXEDO OS][15] are offered at a price just shy of **‚Ç¨1000 excl. tax/shipping for buyers outside Germany**.

For German purchasers, the price is ‚Ç¨1189 incl. tax, and shipping is free.

They also point out that they have Linux-trained customer support, should any issues arise, and there are multiple operating systems to choose from, apart from TUXEDO OS.

**Don't try this with your own laptop though ü§£**
