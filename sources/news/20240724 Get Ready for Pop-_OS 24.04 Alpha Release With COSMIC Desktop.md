Get Ready for Pop!_OS 24.04 Alpha Release With COSMIC Desktop
======
Can't wait for it already, even if it's the alpha!
[![][1]][2]

It's been ages since we were first introduced to the new avatar of [COSMIC][3], the desktop environment by the creators of [Pop!_OS.][4]

We already knew that the alpha release of COSMIC is arriving around the end of July, but, we didn't have any indication as to when we would see it on Pop!_OS.

Luckily, that has now changed. 😃

In a tweet [on X][5], Founder and CEO of System76, [Carl Richell][6] announced that **the first alpha release of Pop!_OS 24.04 equipped with COSMIC will be released on August 8**.

If you didn't know, Pop!_OS 24.04 will be based on the [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS][10] release, but with many cool bells and whistles, including COSMIC, courtesy of [System76][11].

Sure, **I agree that it's just an Alpha release for Pop!_OS, but, it's better than having a release without this redesigned version of COSMIC**.

If you would like to learn more about COSMIC, then don't stop reading.

### What Can You Expect From COSMIC?

![Source: System76][12]

For starters, the developers recently [introduced][13] the branding for COSMIC, in which the “O” represents open source, signifying their commitment towards the same, with them openly embracing the community for taking COSMIC forward.

_I must say, the O in the logo reminds me of Wall-E._ 🤖

Set to be **Wayland-only** , COSMIC will have support for X11 apps, and will feature some extensive customization features such as app theming, window styling, advanced window tiling, and more.

There's also **a suite of Rust-based native COSMIC apps** that will tie together the whole experience, creating a unique ecosystem, that's open in nature ( _Apple can learn from this_ ).

Some of those apps include:

  * **COSMIC Files**
  * **COSMIC Edit**
  * **COSMIC Terminal**
  * **COSMIC App Store**
  * **COSMIC Screenshot Tool**



If the above still didn't satisfy your need for knowledge, then you should tune in to our [earlier coverage][14] and System76's [podcast][15] to dive deeper into their COSMIC world.
