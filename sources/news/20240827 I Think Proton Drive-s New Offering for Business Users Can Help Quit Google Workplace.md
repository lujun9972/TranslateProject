I Think Proton Drive's New Offering for Business Users Can Help Quit Google Workplace
======
A secure cloud storage space for businesses and teams.

Having a secure cloud storage solution, be it self-hosted, or managed, is an important thing to consider if you have important files that you need access to on the go. Some [popular cloud storage options][3] include names like Nextcloud, Mega, pCloud, etc.

Proton's [Drive][4] product is also one such option, which is a relatively new entry in this space, but one that has managed to garner the interest of many users.

A recent announcement sees Proton Drive's new business offering.

With this, the ability to use a privacy-friendly collaboration platform becomes a better possibility when compared to big tech offerings like Google Workplace. It may not be a complete replacement yet, but it is getting closer with every new Proton offering geared for business users.

### Proton Drive for Business: What to Expect?

![][5]

Proton has introduced **a new business-focused plan for Drive** , which is tailored for use by teams of professionals working within an organization.

When opting for this, users will get access to all the usual Drive features, like an **intuitive user interface** , **real-time secure collaboration** , **cross-platform apps** , and **easy/secure file sharing** with access control.

But, to further sweeten the deal, there's also support for enabling two-factor authentication for accounts, access to the Proton Business suite, and [Proton Sentinel][6] acting as an additional security layer in the event of a breach.

On the **compliance side of things** , businesses can take advantage of Proton Drive's full compliance with [GDPR][7] and [HIPAA][8], all running on [ISO 27001][9]-certified infrastructure, backed by Swiss privacy laws and neutrality.

When introducing this, Product Team Lead at Proton, [Anant Vijay Singh][10], added that:

> In a landscape where data breaches and corporate surveillance are on the rise, Proton Drive is the secure choice for businesses that can't afford to compromise on privacy. With end-to-end encryption and zero-access architecture, your data remains safe—even in the event of a data breach.

You can go through the [announcement blog][11] to learn more about this.
