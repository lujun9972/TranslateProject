Kubuntu 24.04 LTS is Just a Good Upgrade!
======
Kubuntu 24.04 LTS could be a little boring without KDE Plasma 6, but
it's a nice upgrade.
Kubuntu is a KDE Plasma-equipped [Ubuntu flavor][1] that many users pick due to its set of applications and a user interface. While some users do get confused as to [which is the better choice][2] between Ubuntu and Kubuntu, the latter usually feels just at home for those switching from Windows.

Now, **Kubuntu 24.04 LTS** just landed, based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS improving things on offer. It does not feature a lot of exciting changes, but something is better than nothing, right?

Let me give you the highlights of the release.

### Kubuntu 24.04 LTS: What's New?

![][3]

Powered by [Linux kernel 6.8][4], Kubuntu 24.04 LTS is an important release **supported until April 2027** , that brings about some interesting changes.

The **key highlights** of this release include:

  * **Installer Changes**
  * **Upgraded KDE Software**
  * **New Wallpapers**



#### Installer Changes

![][5]

Similar to what the developers of [Lubuntu][6] did, **Kubuntu 24.04 LTS has switched to the** [**Calamares**][7] **installer by default**. **** By doing so, they have skipped using Ubuntu's Flutter-based installer.

![][8]

However, **they have embraced installation modes**. There are three install modes, the first is “ _Full Installation_ ”, which will install a few additional applications alongside the operating system, the second is “ _Normal Installation_ ”, which is the default one with useful apps/utilities.

And, the final one is “ _Minimal Installation_ ”, which only installs the desktop environment, with no pre-installed apps or tools being included.

#### Upgraded KDE Software

![][9]

On the KDE front, **Kubuntu 24.04 LTS ships with an older** [**KDE Plasma 5.27.11**][10] for handling the desktop environment duties, skipping the recent [Plasma 6][11] release, which [is set][12] to be offered with the upcoming non-LTS Kubuntu 24.10 release.

So, yes, it is a bummer for Kubuntu 24.04 LTS to miss out on KDE Plasma 6.

This release also features [_KDE Frameworks 5.115.0_][13], with various bug fixes and improvements.

#### New Wallpapers

![][14]

Kubuntu 24.04 LTS comes loaded with many new wallpapers too!

These were selected from the [wallpaper contest][15] that the Kubuntu team ran. As you can see above, the first seven wallpapers are from the winners, **Gregorio** , **Dilip** , and **Jack Sharp**.

They have **also updated their branding** with the winner of the [Kubuntu Brand Graphic Design contest][16], Fabio Maricato's work. But, sadly, when I was checking out the beta build of Kubuntu 24.04 LTS, it didn't feature it.

You can check out the new wallpapers, and Kubuntu's updated branding on its [GitHub repo][17].

The stable build of Kubuntu 24.04 LTS also features the rebranding, do let me know in the comments if you liked it or not. 💬

#### Other Improvements

To wrap this up, this Kubuntu release features the [_Firefox 117_][18] release as a snap package, offers ** [_LibreOffice 24.2_][19] as the office suite, uses ** [_Qt 5.15.12_][20], and has [PipeWire][21] to serve as the default audio backend.

**As for the Wayland question** , there's no solid answer as to when Kubuntu will switch to a Wayland by default approach. For further reading, you can also refer to the official [release notes][22].

### 📥 Getting Kubuntu 24.04 LTS

This LTS release of Kubuntu is available on the [official website][23] and in the [Ubuntu repository][24], both are viable options.

[Kubuntu 24.04 LTS][23]

For upgrade help, you can refer to the [Kubuntu forum][25].
