Is Linux Really Difficult For a Windows User? My Personal Journey Answers It!
======
As a Windows user, I switched to Linux successfully. And, you can too.
Here's what I think.
[![][1]][2]

A few years ago, I used to be a Windows-only user, with brief stints using Ubuntu on the college computers. Eventually, I went for a dual-boot setup on my desktop with Windows 10 and Ubuntu to get the best of both worlds.

That is, until recently, when my desktop's [PSU][3] went haywire due to a faulty APC UPS being unable to handle power fluctuations. Since the replacement would take some time and I couldn't stay without a functioning computer, I went out and got a laptop for my day-to-day work.

Initially, it came with Windows 11 pre-installed, and I was able to get work done, but running [Linux][4] distributions ( _distros_ ) in a [virtual machine][5] has its limitations.

Soon after, **I completely switched to Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS** , and that ran great until I had to test some [tools for checking GPU usage][6].

A simple GPU driver switch made Ubuntu [flip out][7], and I had to switch to [Fedora][8] in the middle of a workweek. But, don't let that deter you from the fact that Linux distros are the future of computing ( _in my humble opinion_ ).

So, join me as I take you through my experience switching to Linux full-time on my work laptop and the challenges I faced when I started out using Linux all those years ago after being a Windows user.

üìã

I have used the terms ****Linux**** and ****Linux distributions**** interchangeably. However, remember that Linux is the kernel and distributions are the operating systems built around it, with various components.

### Give Linux Some Time, You Will Forget Windows

![][9]

When I started using Linux a few years prior, the first things that I was confused by were the many package managers and package types.

It took me some time to wrap my head around the _APT_ package manager on Ubuntu and the different packages used to install/run software, such as _DEB_ , _Flatpak_ , _Snap_ , _AppImage_ , etc.

üí°

****Takeaway for you:**** You do not need to worry about what you're using when starting out. ****Whether your software center lists Snap/deb/rpm/Flatpak pckages, you can install any of them to get the job done.****

Just keep in mind that ****Snaps/Flatpaks offer newer versions of the packages****.

I was also confused as to what [desktop environments][10] were, but, I became comfortable with all of those concepts in a day or two thanks to the helpful resources on **It's FOSS**.

You might want to check out the options available and see what layout/concept suits you the best. And, then pick a Linux distro accordingly:

![][11]

My pick was **GNOME** for its unique layout:

![][12]

Now, my day-to-day includes me doing lots of research on any potential stories I can cover or looking for new apps or tools for Linux that may be of use to our readers. In this process, I end up opening loads of windows and web browser tabs, which need to be arranged properly for me to make sense of things.

That is where [GNOME][13]'s handy workspaces feature comes in, allowing me to spread out the app windows according to my preference. Similarly, I extensively use the Chromium-based [Vivaldi][14] web browser as my primary work browser due to its exceptional tab handling features.

I have found applications on Linux for almost everything I need:

  * An app for editing images ( _GIMP_ ) ‚úîÔ∏è
  * An app for streaming music ( _Spotify_ ) ‚úîÔ∏è
  * A VPN app ( _Proton VPN_ ) to dodge nosy Big Tech corps and ISPs ‚úîÔ∏è
  * A well-equipped office suite ( _LibreOffice_ ) ‚úîÔ∏è



**So, unless you are dependent on a special software tailored specially for Windows. You do not have to break a sweat on Linux for the app you need.**

Next, the mind-blowing part of Linux for me ü§Ø

I can customize a Linux distribution to extents that won't be possible on a proprietary operating system like Windows.

**Turns out, it is easy to do that** (with many advanced options to explore later)!

Just take the above photo of my work setup, for instance. I have many cool [GNOME extensions][15] in place, I can quickly check the details of my system using [Fastfetch][16], and I can even swap out the desktop environment ( _GNOME_ ) to something more minimal like [LXQt][17].

The window tiling with the GNOME extension on my previous Ubuntu desktop looked like this:

![][18]

So, if you are picking Ubuntu/Fedora, you are going to enjoy things like this. There's also a clip of me using this functionality across multiple displays with Ubuntu, and it is really neat:

And, the possibilities of doing things like this on Linux is endless üòÑ

**Even** **gaming is a joy** üéÆ

Earlier this year, I [tested out][19] Cyberpunk 2077, and it ran without any hiccups, performing impressively, which then motivated me to dedicate [30 days][20] during which I exclusively played native Linux games, with the end result being superb.

### If You Are Ready to Switch...

Taking my experience as an indicator, if you are ready to make the jump, you need to realize that whether it is Windows/macOS/Linux, none of them are perfect.

**However, Linux is not difficult to use**. You just need to put some time learning about it ( _as it is entirely new for you_ ) before you jump into installing a Linux distribution.

**It has got all the essential apps, utilities to game, edit videos, create content, produce music, develop software,** and as a **bonus** , **the freedom to control every aspect of it** (if you know enough about it).

To get started, I would recommend you to try [Linux Mint][22], which features a familiar user interface with many desktop environment choices. The other pick would be [Ubuntu][23], which makes things effortless ( _for the most part_ ) with its well-rounded package.

In the end, **a few pain points do remain** , mostly related to gaming and a few popular video editing software ( _Adobe suite isn't available_ ), but that's fine. I can play games with pesky anti-cheat software on my Windows-equipped desktop, and there are many wonderful [open-source video editors on Linux][24] that can serve your needs.

Looking at the state of the most [popular Linux distributions][25], I can confidently say that even non-technical people or students can easily get into Linux without the fear of getting lost üòé

Moreover, I have also realized that **I still have much more to learn about Linux**. I can't wait to dig in deeper, improving my understanding and providing you, the readers, with good-quality content.

_üí¨ How has your Linux journey been? Faced any issues? Couldn't be more satisfied? Let me know!_
