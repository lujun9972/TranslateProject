Exciting! TUXEDO is Working on the First Snapdragon Powered Linux Laptop!
======
Linux on ARM by TUXEDO. Will it be a Linux alternative to a powerful
MacBook? Let's see!

Linux worked on the ARM platform way before Apple's M1 chip existed. However, the Apple Silicon chip popularized the concept of ARM-based laptops and computers.

And, since then, we haven't had a proper (and powerful) Linux-focused ARM-based laptop.

Sure, users may have tested running Linux ARM distributions on some mainstream Snapdragon laptops. But, it wasn't officially targeted to run Linux.

Fast-forward to the **Computex 2024** event, TUXEDO (a Linux-focused laptop/pc manufacturer) [reveals][3] that it is working on a **laptop running on top of the cutting-edge Snapdragon Elite SoC from Qualcomm.**

### What Do We Know So Far?

TUXEDO showcased their first prototype at Computex 2024 that runs on Snapdragon Elite SoC.

Compared to any other previous attempts, Qualcomm is officially pushing for Linux support with its latest series of ARM chips. And, we have covered it recently:

So, it is no surprise that a Linux laptop manufacturer chose to utilize the platform to give a powerful x86 alternative to the users.

The laptop features the following specifications:

  * Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite 12 Cores, 20 W TDP
  * 14-inch 16:10 IPS display with **2560 x 1440** resolution (400 nits brightness)
  * 32 GB LPDDR5X
  * 1 x M.2 PCIe Gen 4 SSD Slot
  * 50 Wh battery



Of course, the laptop will be featuring [TUXEDO OS][6], an Ubuntu-based distribution featuring KDE Plasma desktop with laptop-focused utilities to tweak the performance and experience.

Regarding the current status, TUXEDO mentions:

> We have been working with a first prototype for some time, which will soon be replaced by a second one. The development is still in the alpha stage, as some drivers are still missing, which will hopefully be available with the next two kernel versions.

### Release Date

TUXEDO wants to aim for Christmas 2024. However, they cannot give an exact release date because there are numerous things to do before one can be sure about it.

You can keep an eye on our portal or TUXEDO's official feed to stay tuned for its availability 😄
