Regata OS 24 “Arctic Fox” is a Big Upgrade With KDE Plasma 6 and Other Refinements
======
Regata OS 24 brings in plenty of new goodies with meaningful tweaks.
You know, we are so used to seeing Debian or Fedora-based distros that we forget distros based on [openSUSE][1] exist. One such Linux distribution is Regata OS, which focuses on providing a good experience for both desktop and gaming use cases.

With a recent announcement, the developers have introduced a new release in the form of the Regata OS 24 “Arctic Fox”, which promises plenty of new features and improvements.

_I really like the codename for it; “Arctic Fox”. I can never get enough of those furballs doing their shenanigans!_

But, let's move on to the news, or I will keep on talking about Foxes... 😊

## 🆕 Regata OS 24 “Arctic Fox”: What's New?

![][2]

Powered by the recently released [Linux kernel 6.7][3], Regata OS also comes with [Mesa 24][4] for providing better hardware and game support.

Some **key highlights** of this release include:

  * KDE Plasma 6
  * Updated Applications
  * Better Hardware Support



### KDE Plasma 6

As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, Regata OS 24 ships with [KDE Plasma 6][5]. With this, **Regata OS now defaults to Wayland** , with the option to switch to the X11 session.

Then there are major changes, such as a new overview/task switcher, a new 3D cube effect when switching desktops, floating panels by default, faster Plasma search and more.

### Updated Applications

![Regata OS Store][7]

To complement that, Regata OS's developers worked on **improving the user experience for many of their applications** ; With subtle visual changes, improvements to the dark theme, implementation of rounded corners, and a few other changes.

Moreover, they also included a recent version of [ONLYOFFICE][9], **installed by default** on Regata OS.

### Better Hardware Support

Thanks to the inclusion of Linux kernel 6.7, there is better support for a wide variety of hardware.

**In the case of Intel** , support for Meteor Lake graphics is now enabled by default, as it is considered stable in the kernel release.

**For NVIDIA** , there is now support for the NVIDIA GPU System Processor (GSP) firmware in Nouveau that **improves the performance of newer cards from RTX 20 and later** series by a considerable margin.

Though, **Regato OS's devs still recommend using the proprietary NVIDIA driver** for those who want the most out of their NVIDIA GPU.

**On the AMD side of things** , there has been a major jump in Ray-Tracing performance thanks to Mesa 24 with support for many new Vulkan extensions.

The updated version of Mesa also brings about patches for games such as _The Finals_ , _Assassin's Creed Odyssey_ , _Doom Eternal_ , _LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga_ and a few more.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

As for the rest, here are some other changes worth noting:

  * Better support for Dell and Lenovo keyboards.
  * A fix for a regression that occurred with Flatpak apps.
  * Support for the “ _Cooler Boost_ ” feature on MSI laptops.
  * Improvements for newer Intel/AMD sound and sensor monitoring hardware.
  * Regata OS Game Access now uses [VKD3D-Proton 2.12][10] for better DirectX 12 support.



As you may have now realized, this update is huge, to get finer details you can refer to the official [announcement blog][11].

## 📥 Download Regata OS 24

The developers have made this release available on their [official website][12] with two variants to choose from, one is the usual image, the other is the one with NVIDIA drivers.
