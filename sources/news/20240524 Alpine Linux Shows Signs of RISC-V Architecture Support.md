Alpine Linux Shows Signs of RISC-V Architecture Support
======
RISC-V support to Apline Linux is coming around starting with this
release.

Alpine Linux is a popular choice among users who prefer a lightweight Linux distro experience. **Interesting bit:** What started off as a fork of the [LEAF Project][3] now focuses on two key things: Security, and Reliability.

Over the years, Alpine Linux has been receiving regular updates with varying degrees of fixes and improvements. One such update is the recently introduced **Alpine Linux 3.2.0** release, which has some important changes to offer.

Let's take a brief look at it.

## 🆕 Alpine Linux 3.2.0: What's New?

Powered by [Linux kernel 6.6][5], Alpine Linux 3.2.0 is a stable release with the following key highlights:

  * **Initial RISC-V Support**
  * **Desktop Environment Upgrades**
  * **Refined Packages**



### Initial RISC-V Support

For the first time with this release, we now have initial support for the [RISC-V][6] platform on Alpine Linux.

Details on this are scarce, but the developers have mentioned in the release blog that there is now **support for 64-bit RISC-V implementations**.

It's great to see another popular Linux distro adding support for this! 😀

### Desktop Environment Upgrades

On the desktop environment side of things, Alpine Linux comes equipped with the recent [GNOME 46][8] release. You can take advantage of things like better notifications, fractional scaling support, a reorganized settings app, updated core apps, and more.

If you are not interested in that, then there's the inclusion of [KDE Plasma 6][11], which brings about improvements like HDR support, an improved Discover app, a new wallpaper, Wayland by default, etc.
