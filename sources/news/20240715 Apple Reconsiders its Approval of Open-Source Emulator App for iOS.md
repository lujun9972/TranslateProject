Apple Reconsiders its Approval of Open-Source Emulator App for iOS
======
Thank you, Apple, more open-source options for the users!
[![][1]][2]

If I got a dime each time [Apple][3] did something to gatekeep their ecosystem, I would've been a wealthy man by now 😁

Just a month or so ago, they had decided to [block the publishing][4] of an open-source emulator app for iOS, without providing any clarity over what the issue was.

Even the developers gave up, citing that UTM SE was a “ _subpar experience and isn't worth fighting for_ ”, and unless Apple changed their stance, they wouldn't invest any additional time/effort into it.

But, in a surprise move, Apple has gone back on the initial gatekeeping-fueled decision, which is unusual to see.

### Apple Warms Up To UTM SE: What Gives?

> We are happy to announce that UTM SE is available (for free) on iOS and visionOS App Store (and coming soon to AltStore PAL)!
>
> Shoutouts to AltStore team for their help and to Apple for reconsidering their policy.[https://t.co/HAV5JnT5GO][5]

Over the weekend, UTM [announced][7] that UTM SE was now available for iOS and visionOS, and that the [AltStore][8] team helped them out, with a thanks to Apple for revisiting their policy.

If you are not familiar, UTM SE is the less powerful version of [UTM][9], an emulator/virtual machine host for Apple devices that allows users to run different operating systems on their machines.

Some **key features** include:

  * **Based on QEMU**
  * **Custom Configs for Machines**
  * **Support for emulating x86, RISC-V, and PPC.**
  * **VGA Mode for Graphics & Terminal Mode for Text-Only**



Having said that, the emulation experience for old operating systems with this should be decent, but, don't expect anything extraordinary like running a modern Linux distro such as Ubuntu or Fedora in their full glory, with usable performance.

That is thanks to the lack of [JIT][10] support, which Apple still closely guards, keeping it locked up, citing “ _security reasons_ ”. Here's the catch, though, Android has had that support for ages now.

Naturally, the [Sherlock Holmes][11] in me thinks that Apple just doesn't want to be caught lacking, trying to skirt their way around the [Digital Markets Act][12] (DMA). Take [the battle][13] between them and Epic Games, which has seen them finally [approve][14] the Epic Games store app for iOS in Europe, after they rejected it **twice**.

_I still think that Apple doesn't really learn until it is forced to._ 😆

### 📥 Get UTM SE

For now, those who are interested in trying UTM SE out can get it from the [App Store][15], where it has been made available for the **iPhone** , **iPad** , and **Apple Vision**.

[UTM SE (App Store)][15]

The developers have also mentioned that UTM SE will be arriving at [AltStore PAL][16] very soon ( _as mentioned in the tweet above_ ). It is a store geared towards European users, which is open-source and decentralized in nature.

_💬 What do you think of Apple's decision? Are they trying to avoid a compliance issue with DMA?_
