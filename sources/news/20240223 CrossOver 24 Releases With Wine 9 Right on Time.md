CrossOver is a paid software built on top of open-source components to help you run Windows software on Linux (and macOS).

If you did not know about it, just know it is more of a “premium Wine” experience.

With every release, it makes it convenient for users to install games and software seamlessly, like the [EA app support with CrossOver 23][1].

What do we with the newest CrossOver 24 upgrade? Let's find out:

### CrossOver 24: What's New?

![][2]

CrossOver 24 features the latest and greatest [Wine 9.0][3], released just a month back.

Naturally, all the improvements that you get with Wine 9.0 will be reflected through CrossOver 24. So, if you had an application facing issues, you could get a flawless experience this time (it depends, but possibly!).

In addition to the core update, there have been much-needed tweaks to the UI:

  * Drag and drop executables into CrossOver to run/install them
  * Drag and drop executable within CrossOver to the target bottle, and run it in a single click
  * Create a launcher icon for applications on Linux for quick access



Furthermore, you now get the ability to change the default directory for the bottle:

You can find the option through CrossOver preferences. This gives you flexibility to store big games/apps on an external drive.
