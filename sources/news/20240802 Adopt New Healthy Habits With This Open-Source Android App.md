Adopt New Healthy Habits With This Open-Source Android App
======
Start your personal growth journey of tracking habits with this useful
Android app.
[![][1]][2]

Just like the simpler productivity timer app, [Goodtime][3], I came across something focused on a single task for Android users, i.e., helping you develop habits and keep track of them.

Often, the default health application from your manufacturer will have these abilities. However, most of them record your data to sync or may offer a lot more features than what you really need.

So, whether you want to train yourself to do better at sports/gym or drink water regularly, a simple open-source Android app should come to the rescue.

### Table Habit: Open-Source Companion to Track Habits

![][4]

Table Habit is a free and open-source Android app featuring the Material You UI to provide a modern experience.

It is pretty straightforward to use. You just need to add your habits, fill up the required fields for it, and you can get started tracking them.

For starters, you just need to put the habit name, and frequency of the occurrence for your goal. By default, every goal starts with a 66-day long habit. You can customize the goal duration up to 365 days, and also adjust the frequency in a granular manner.

You can set it to X times a week, X times a month, X times in X days, or daily.

In addition, you can also set reminders for each habit. So, you don't forget about them, or do not need another app to remind you to track those habits.

It is interesting to see that you can add positive and negative habits. However, it does not visually distinguish itself as much as I would want it to. Maybe there are plans to do that, which should make this feature more useful.

There's also this nifty feature to copy the template of a habit you created. So, you do not have to set the days/frequency/goal limit for every habit added.

Ultimately, you can configure a few things, like the action to mark a habit as complete (tap/long-press/double-tap), and also import/export your data.
