I Think This is the Most Beautiful Mastodon Android Client!
======
A nice Mastodon experience with this Android app.
Mastodon is an open-source decentralized social media platform. You can break free from the annoyances of big tech owned platforms, and sign up for any Mastodon instance for a switch,

You can even host your instance, right?

All of that is well and good. But, I always find the official Mastodon client for Android lacking, and uninteresting. I did try a separate client ([Tusky][1]), I think it is a better option, but I wasn't satisfied with it.

I think that was one of the reasons I chose to be inactive for sometime on Mastodon. It was not compelling enough for me to access it on my phone, **until now**.

I stumbled upon **Moshidon**. A pretty looking Mastodon client that adopts the latest **Material You** design principles of Android. So, I gave it a try.

### Moshidon: A Sleek User Experience

[Moshidon][3] is a free and open-source fork of megalodon (which is a fork of the official Mastodon client).

It aims to equip you with extra features that improve your Mastodon experience, and beautifies it with the modern Material You UI.

For many users, Android apps adopting the Material You design is a big deal. So, anyone who likes it will love it at first glance.

And, for the users who focus on the functionalities, I don't think they will be let down with Moshidon either.

Some of the key features that you get with Moshidon include:

  * Bookmarks
  * Pinning posts
  * Alt text reminder for better accessibility for others
  * Unlisted posts
  * Color themes
  * Moderated Federated timeline
  * Color themes
  * Filter posts with warnings



You get several functionalities that are essential to the Mastodon experience with Moshidon, along with a pretty looking user interface.

Like the screenshot above, and the one attached below, you can notice that all of it looks organized, and neat. The ease of searching for the posts you want, quickly taking a look at the news being discussed, and overall layout can be appreciated.

### Download and Install Moshidon

Moshidon is available on the [Google Play Store][5], [F-Droid][6], and [GitHub][3].

If you are new to Mastodon, and haven't decided on an instance to join, you can try these:

_💭 What do you think about Moshidon? Is there a better Mastodon client that I missed? Feel free to let me know!_
