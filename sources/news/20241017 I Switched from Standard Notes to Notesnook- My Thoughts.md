I Switched from Standard Notes to Notesnook: My Thoughts!
======
It was time for me to try a new note-taking app that suits my
requirements. Let's give Notesnook a try!
[![][1]][2]

As a writer, [note-taking apps][3] are a boon for me. I use such apps to organize my day-to-day life, both personal and professional. These apps help me note down important information, create to-dos, track daily tasks, and much more.

Back in 2022, I started using [Standard Notes][4] on a web browser for my work-related note-taking, and it was going well until earlier this year, when I felt the need to have [rich text][5] editing.

The free plan of Standard Notes didn't include this basic feature, and I had to look around for alternatives. That is when I learned about [Notesnook][6], which offers rich text editing with its free plan, along with some other neat features.

Notesnook went [open source back in 2022][7]. Since then, it has been growing in terms of popularity, with a thriving community around it.

Now, I have successfully integrated it into my workflow over the past few months, and I would like to share with you my experience so far.

📋

Most notes have been redacted in the screenshots as they contain sensitive information, like how to manifest [Hamon][8]. 😆

Nonetheless, I have added a [humorous note][9] that should be a fun placeholder.

### Standard Notes Is Good

![][10]

Standard Notes is not all that bad. It has end-to-end encryption and a decent editor, with the paid plan unlocking more editing tools and advanced note management features than the paid version of Notesnook does.

Its objective is to provide “ _a steel vault for your mind_ ” with its privacy-focused approach that has been [audited][11] for security by third-party security firms. ( _Notesnook hasn't been audited yet_ ).

![Standard Notes themes and note properties.][12]

Additionally, there are **many features available with the free plan** , such as offline access, encrypted email backups, 100 MB of storage, note export, password-protected notes, and more.

Sadly, many of its important features are locked behind a paywall. That was another pain point for me, which led me to look for other options.

### But Switching To Notesnook Worked Out

![][14]

When I started using Notesnook, **the user interface felt familiar** , with a note list to the left and the editor to the right. I just had to copy over my content from Standard Notes and organize it.

You can utilize [Notesnook Importer][15] for the job or do it manually.

If you are a long-time user of note-taking apps, you might be acquainted with [Evernote][16]'s user interface, and Notesnook's interface may remind you of that. It's not a bad thing, of course.

**Notesnook presents a comfortable user experience** that caters to all kinds of users, whether they are switching from Standard Notes like me, or proprietary options like Evernote.

The editor has handy tools at the top to format the text, using which I am able to easily create easy-to-read and organized notes. I have the freedom to choose **different font sizes** , **headings** , **bullet points** and add _bold/italic/underline_ formatting to texts to emphasize them.

![][17]

In addition, the editor also supports keyboard shortcuts for those, and the “ _Focus mode_ ” ( _the spectacle icon_ ) function allows me to concentrate on the writing itself, hiding all the unnecessary user interface elements.

At the top, the search tool is handy for finding words, and a publish function called Monograph ( _the cloud icon_ ) lets me **generate shareable links for notes** so that I can share them with others.

The humorous note shared at the beginning of this article is the result of that.

![][18]

There's also the ability to pin notes, add them as favorites, lock them with a password, make them read-only, and a **separate page for reminders** where I could add important tasks to be reminded of.

Similarly, organizing notes is easy with **the tags feature**. But, for adding custom colors, I would have to sign up for the paid Pro plan, which, now I realize, is priced really well for me in my region ( _India_ ) when compared to Standard Notes; more on this later.

There's also **support for community-built themes** , which change the look and feel of Notesnook. My current favorite is “ _Crimson Carbon_ ,” but I like to mix things up from time to time.

![Notesnook theme selection.][19]

The other most essential aspects of Notesnook for me are the **end-to-end encryption** , which keeps my notes secure, and the **tab functionality** , which allows me to multitask by opening up multiple notes.

### Pricing Differences

![Standard Notes and Notesnook pricing for India.][20]

Even though **the pricing for these services was never a deciding factor for me** , I was surprised to see how big of a gap there was in terms of affordability. For [Standard Notes][21], I would have to pay ~₹7,057 ($84) per year for the “ _Professional_ ” plan and ~₹5,292 ($63) for the “ _Productivity_ ” plan.

In contrast, **** [**Notesnook**][22] **has a far more affordable pricing plan** , with only a “ _Pro_ ” plan in their lineup for individual users, costing ~₹1010 (~$12) per year. This makes me think about going for a paid plan to support development.

📋

The currency conversion is for the pricing plan I see from India. As per the rates, and region, this might differ.

#### Closing Thoughts

![Spotty The Cat][23]

What you've read so far represents my everyday usage of note-taking apps, but both Notesnook and Standard Notes have more to offer. As a casual user, I've only scratched the surface of their capabilities.

For me, I like a good [WYSIWYG][24] note-taking app that has a decent rich text editor, a straightforward user interface, and some neat dark-colored themes.

Hence, I will be sticking with Notesnook for a long time, until I feel the need to switch.
