KeePassXC 2.7.8 Release Adds Enhancements to Passkeys
======
KeePassXC 2.7.8 is here with passkey improvements and new import
support.
For many users, KeePassXC is the [best password manager for Linux][1] because of the wide range of features it offers in a relatively compact package.

Not to forget, it is also an incredibly popular option among privacy-focused users who do not want a cloud-powered solution like Bitwarden.

In a [recent announcement][2], the developers introduced the **KeePassXC 2.7.8** release, which offers plenty of improvements and bug fixes.

Let's check it out.

## 🆕 KeePassXC 2.7.8: What's New?

![][4]

KeePassXC 2.7.8 has improvements across the board, with **a focus on beefing up the passkey support** that was introduced in the [earlier release][5].

Now, users can update an existing passkey or add a new passkey to an existing entry. Apart from that, there's the newly added support for NFC/USB transports, extension JSON data now being passed to the browser, and a warning about the data being unencrypted during passkey export.

On the other hand, importing for [Bitwarden][6] (1PUX file) and [1Password][7] has been improved, new hotkeys were added, Flatpak support was improved, a fix for clearing the clipboard on Wayland sessions, and many miscellaneous bugs were also addressed.

I tried testing out the passkey support on KeePassXC, but I was unable to make it work on my setup; maybe I misconfigured it? But, I think it is not as seamless as it is on Bitwarden for my initial impressions.

If you made it work, please let me know in the comments down below! 😄

I highly suggest you refer to the [official documentation][8] to configure passkeys on KeePassXC correctly.
