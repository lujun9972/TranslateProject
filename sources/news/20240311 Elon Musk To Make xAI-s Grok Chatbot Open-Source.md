Elon Musk To Make xAI's Grok Chatbot Open-Source
======
A new chatbot entering the open-source arena. What are you doing OpenAI?
Surprise, surprise, surprise!, Elon Musk has announced something very interesting related to one of X's (formerly known as Twitter) flagship AI offerings.

With a [tweet][1], Elon has unveiled that [xAI][2] will be open-sourcing [Grok][3], their generative AI chatbot based on an in-house LLM called _Grok-1_ with the added bonus of access to content on X.

> This week, [@xAI][4] will open source Grok
>
> — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) [March 11, 2024][5]

Launched back in November 2023, I didn't really hear much about it apart from the facts that **you would have to be an X Premium+ subscriber to get access to Grok** and that it **was not open-source**.

But, it now seems that the former is no longer the case thanks to this announcement.

To complement this move, even [Baby Grok][6] has joined in, [acknowledging][7] that it is also going open source. If you didn't know, **Baby Grok is a crypto meme coin** launched at the same time around Grok, a cryptocurrency whose value depends on its community.

**Does it Matter?**

For Elon Musk and many open-source enthusiasts, it certainly does. You see, Elon has been in a [legal battle][10] with [OpenAI][11] and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, alleging that the company has deviated from its original non-profit, open-source mission.

The story is still constantly developing, with the most recent being a [string of emails][12] being shared by OpenAI that said **Musk wanted to merge them with Tesla** , or he wanted full control over the company.

During all that, many did [point out][13] that Elon has not open-sourced xAI's technology. But, I think he took that very seriously, and now we have this announcement to open source Grok.

Whatever the driving force behind his decision may be, I am genuinely interested in how it pans out in the end, as this will surely be a big shot at OpenAI, who refuse to open-source their most popular products.

**When to Expect:** Sometime this week is the timeline Elon has shared, and if you were to take [the past][14] as any indication, then you should see the code [go open][15] eventually when the time comes.

_💬 Well, did you expect this move to come? Or were you expecting something else?_
