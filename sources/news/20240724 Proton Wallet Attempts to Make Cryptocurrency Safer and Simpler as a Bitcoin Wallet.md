Proton Wallet Attempts to Make Cryptocurrency Safer and Simpler as a Bitcoin Wallet
======
Now, you can keep your bitcoins safe with Proton Wallet.

[Proton][3] has been busy this year. They have been at it, pushing upgrades to their existing services by adding new functionality and addressing issues.

A week after adding an [open-source AI writing assistant][4] to their Mail service, they have yet again introduced a new tool to further bolster their privacy-focused suite of apps and services.

The new service is called “ **Proton Wallet** ” and is aimed at users of [Bitcoin][5].

### Proton Wallet: A Safe Haven For Bitcoin

![][6]

Rolled out in a limited, early access manner, **Proton Wallet is a self-custodial wallet for storing Bitcoin** , with Proton's well-known end-to-end-encryption tech [safeguarding it][7].

As for what a self-custodial wallet is. It ensures that a user doesn't lose control over their encryption keys, allowing them to **not lose access to their Bitcoin or their digital assets**.

In this case, even if Proton as an organization were to go shut down, a user's wallet would be safe, in contrast to the many horror shows we have seen in recent times ( _read_ [_FTX_][9]).

During the launch, Director of Engineering at Proton, [Dingchao Lu][10] added that:

> Proton has experienced first-hand the dangers of the traditional financial sector. In 2014 PayPal temporarily froze our assets and nearly ended Proton before it even got started.

> That moment has stayed in our minds ever since and with the launch of Proton Wallet we want to reduce the world’s dependence on centralized financial institutions.

> By giving users control of their own encryption keys and their own digital assets, we’re offering financial freedom, improved privacy and safety to millions of people around the world.

**Some key features** of this wallet include things like having an **open-source/independently audited nature** , **allowing users to send/receive Bitcoin via Email** , and **enabling users to buy Bitcoin in over 150 countries** , thanks to integration with licensed third parties.

The user interface looks pretty sleek in my opinion:

There's also support for **two-factor authentication** , and a possibility of **adding support for other currencies**. But, that depends on the feedback they receive from users after the full launch. At launch, only Bitcoin will be supported.

Proton has also mentioned that **in the near future they will be offering a Proton Wallet Plus plan** that will come equipped with their [Proton Sentinel][12] protection program for particularly vulnerable users such as activists, journalists, executives, etc.

For more details on all of this, refer to the [announcement blog][13].

### Get Proton Wallet

**Proton Wallet will be limited to the users of the Proton Visionary plan and Lifetime plan**. Those users can then choose to invite other people to try out Proton Wallet.

For the rest of us, we will either have to sign up for the waitlist for a chance at getting early access, or simply wait it out until they fully launch it.

In any case, users with or without access can head to the [official website][14] to get additional information on that and sign up for the waiting list.
