KaOS 2024.05 Release Gets Closer to Ditch X11 for Wayland
======
KaOS 2024.04 brings in good improvements for the users.
[![][1]][2]

KaOS is a pretty unique [independent Linux distro][3] that aims to provide the latest KDE experience and follows a rolling release approach to handle updates.

It started off 2024 with a major [2024.01 release][4] that featured an early build of KDE Plasma 6 before any other distro.

Now, we have yet another release in the form of **KaOS 2024.05** , which has some useful enhancements. Let's get started.

## 🆕 KaOS 2024.05: What's New?

![][5]

With Linux kernel 6.8.11 powering it, this release is all about improving the overall functionality of KaOS.

Here are a few key highlights:

  * **Support for bcachefs**
  * **Initial Wayland Work**
  * **Updated Application Stack**



### Support for bcachefs

![][6]

Introduced as an experimental feature, KaOS now has support for the copy-on-write (COW) filesystem, [bcachefs][7]. The developers have added all the necessary bcachefs-tool to the repositories for anyone to use.

### Initial Wayland Work

Thanks to the inclusion of the [SDDM 0.20.0][8] display manager, **KaOS is now closer to the transition to Wayland** than ever before. When that happens, like many distros, KaOS will join the Wayland-equipped distro club.

### Updated Application Stack

![][9]

On the application side of things, the [Calamares][10] installer on KaOS now lets you use popular file systems like _XFS_ , _EXT4_ , _BTRFS_ , and _ZFS_ during automated partitioning.

KaOS still uses the [KDE Plasma 6][11] desktop environment, with a few additional KDE elements like Gear 24.05.0 and Frameworks 6.2.0 that have been built on Qt 6.7.1.

This release also marks the inclusion of the [phonon-mpv][12] sound backend, which has resulted in the removal of the previous VLC backend that was not playing nice with Qt6.

Similarly, **GTK2 was completely removed** from the KaOS repositories, and many packages were updated, with some notable ones including:

  * **Systemd 253.19**
  * **OpenSSL 3.3**
  * **Mesa 24.0.7**
  * **Python 3.11**
  * **ZFS 2.2.4**
  * **KMod 32**



And, a new Marknote package has been added, which is a KDE Plasma 6 compatible note management application.

The [release blog][13] has some more technical details that you can go through.

## 📥 Download KaOS 2024.05

You can grab the latest KaOS release from the [official website][14], and for instructions, you can also refer to the [documentation][15].
