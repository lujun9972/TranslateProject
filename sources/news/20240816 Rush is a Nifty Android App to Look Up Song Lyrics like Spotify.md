Rush is a Nifty Android App to Look Up Song Lyrics like Spotify
======
Get the lyrics for your favorite song, easily.

Spotify is a popular music streaming application which also presents a sleek looking interface to read lyrics.

Of course, lyrics are not exclusive to Spotify, sources like Genius include most of the songs.

However, it can be inconvenient to always load up a website, search for the song, and read it from there. So, an app to help automate the process should be a time saver.

That's what Rush is. You can get the information for lyrics here without any fuss.

### Rush: Lyrics Made Easy on Your Mobile

**Rush** is a free and open-source Android app that connects you to certain sources and fetches the lyrics in a Spotify-like style. You can also choose to view the lyrics directly on the Genius website if it suits you.

Just search for the song you want, and you should find it.

You can access the lyrics even if you are offline, and without the music playing (also no ads).

Of course, it is a straightforward app. So, you do not have much to tweak, except the colors. You can also pick to copy the lyrics to your clipboard and save it to your note — if that's what you need.

You can tweak the lyrics' layout to show up with queues/hints to tell you what's the intro/verse 1/verse 2, chorus, etc. And, you can also adjust the number of lines you want to share at a time. By default, this value is 6, but you can change it to anything you require.

The sharing functionality could have been a little intuitive without needing to tap on the lines. But, it makes sense. First, you tap on the lines you would like to share, then click on the share icon.

It will then bring up a card that you share for social media or your friend on the messenger. You can tweak the color and size of that card as well. Here's how that looks:

Furthermore, if you feel like you have filled the app with all the lyrics you do not need, there is a button for you to be able to delete it all.

### Install Rush

You can find Rush on [F-Droid][5]. If you like, you can directly get the APK from its [GitHub page][6] as well.
