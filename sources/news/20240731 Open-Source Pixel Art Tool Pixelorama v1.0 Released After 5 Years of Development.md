Open-Source Pixel Art Tool Pixelorama v1.0 Released After 5 Years of Development
======
Make pixel art or game assets, this is a solid new application based on
the Godot game engine!
[![][1]][2]

[Pixel art][3] is a popular form of digital art that has a wide range of use cases, with games being the most popular one. There are dedicated tools that allow people to create images pixel-by-pixel for recreating the glory days of 8-bit and 16-bit computer graphics.

Many use Adobe's [Photoshop][4] to create pixel art, but, that's proprietary and not available for Linux. Luckily, there are more accessible options for members of the Tux tribe, such as [Aseprite][5], [PixelCraft][6], [Pixel Paint][7], and a few others.

But, there's another contender from [Orama Interactive][8] that's taking the fight to those offerings with its 1.0 release, which was five years in the making since 2019! 😯

And, interestingly, it is built on top of the popular open-source game engine '[Godot][9]'.

### Pixelorama 1.0: What to Expect?

![][10]

Made available under the [MIT License][11], the Pixelorama 1.0 release has debuted with plenty of essential upgrades.

We start with the newly included **layer blend modes** that allow users to add blend modes like Normal, Darken, Multiply, Color burn, Linear burn, Lighten, Screen, Color dodge, Add, Overlay and more.

Then there's the **new curve tool** that facilitates easy creation of pixelated [Bézier curves][12], with size customizability and fill area functionality.

The developers have also included **non-destructive layer effects** , where image effects in Pixelorama can also be applied to each layer of an image without permanently affecting it, unless the user wants it to.

**For the timeline** , it is now possible to drag/drop multiple layers or frames for reordering them, and frame tags can now be created from the right-click menu.

Similarly, **a new color picker panel has been introduced** that replaces the old color picker buttons, with the design of it being pretty self-explanatory.

![][14]

Those **looking to install extensions** can now do so from inside Pixelorama, they just need to go into _Edit_ > _Preferences_ > _Extensions_ , and then click on “ _Explore Online_ ”, after which it will open a new window for browsing the various extensions.

#### 🛠️ Other Changes & Improvements

We wrap this up with a few other notable changes:

  * The _.pxo_ file is now a _.zip_ under the hood.
  * Introduction of a 64-bit ARM build, alongside the 32-bit ARM build.
  * Inclusion of a dedicated Command Line interface for automating tasks.
  * Better application stability compared to 0.x releases, resulting in fewer crashes.
  * Improved performance when drawing and carrying out operations like bucket area fill.



You should give the [announcement blog][15] a read if you are interested in learning more about this tool and the developer's idea for an **Android version** 🤩

### 📥 Get Pixelorama 1.0

There are quite a few ways for you to get the Pixelorama 1.0 release.

The first one is by accessing its free [online version][16], the second one is to get the [Flatpak][17] or [Snap][18] packages.

And, you can purchase it on [Steam][19], or [itch.io][20] as well.

📋

Do note that the paid versions are the same as the free ones, it's just that ****paying directly supports the developers to continue doing their work**** , adding new features and maintaining the project.
