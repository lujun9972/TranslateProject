CachyOS Debuts COSMIC and NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules in August Release
======
CachyOS catches up with the cosmic trend.
[![][1]][2]

CachyOS is a popular [rolling release][3] Arch Linux-based distro which is a good fit for both newbies and experienced Arch users alike.

Months after the [June 2024][4] release, the project's developers have introduced a new **CachyOS August 2024** release, with many useful tweaks, and some good news for users of [NVIDIA][5] GPUs.

Let's check it out. üòÉ

## üÜï CachyOS August 2024: What's New?

![][6]

This release comes with **Linux kernel 6.10.5-cachyos** powering it, alongside [KDE Plasma 6.14][7] as the desktop environment for the flagship desktop edition, and [Mesa 24.2.0][8] handling the graphics side of things.

Some **key highlights** of this release include:

  * **NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules**
  * **Inclusion of COSMIC Alpha**
  * **Infrastructure Upgrades**



### NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules

Beginning with this release, CachyOS's hardware detection will automatically use the [recently introduced][9] open-source GPU kernel modules by NVIDIA. Do note that this support is only for GPUs of 20xx series and newer.

To make things even better, the developers **have made the beta version of the NVIDIA 560 driver the default on CachyOS** after a lot of testing. The kernel manager has also been updated to support building of the NVIDIA-open modules.

### Inclusion of COSMIC Alpha

The next upgrade is the **adoption of the alpha release of the COSMIC desktop environment** in CachyOS, with the developers following the upstream release for packaging.

I checked out COSMIC in the installer when running a [virtual machine][11], and it seemed to install. But, it didn't play nice post installation, and showed me a black screen on reboot. Bare metal should be a better fit for this.

**Existing users can get COSMIC** by running the following command:

```

    sudo pacman -S cosmic-session

```

This will install the base packages required to run COSMIC, with additional packages to get the Rust-based COSMIC apps such as _cosmic-store_ , _cosmic-text_ , and _cosmic-terminal_.

I highly suggest you go through my [earlier coverage][12] of the COSMIC release on Pop!_OS 24.04 Alpha to learn more about this under-development desktop environment:

### Infrastructure Upgrades

The CachyOS team has shared that they now have a new infrastructure sponsor, [CDN77][14], who has equipped them with a global cache [CDN][15], which is set to improve connection speeds for users located around the world.

Now, they are providing **a Cache CDN mirror alongside an Arch Linux mirror** during installation. Mirror ranking has also been tweaked to select up-to-date mirrors, making way for quicker package installations.

There are fallback mirrors hosted by CachyOS and a [Tier 1][16] mirror from Arch Linux in case the primary ones fail for some reason.

### üõ†Ô∏è Other Changes and Improvements

To wrap this up, there are some other notable changes you should know about:

  * [libextest][17] was replaced in favor of [libei][18].
  * cachy-chroot now has support for LUKS encryption.
  * The Handheld edition now supports the [ROG Ally X][19].
  * Secure Boot support was improved with the inclusion of a new script and a detailed Wiki [page][20].
  * Hardware detection has been improved thanks to the fixes in PRIME/Hybrid Profile detection.



To dive deeper into this release, you will want to go through the [release blog][21].

## üì• Download CachyOS

You can download CachyOS from the [official website][22], [mirror][23], or the project's [SourceForge][24] page. There are **two editions on offer,** the Desktop Edition, and the Handheld Edition.

[CachyOS][22]

If you are an **existing user** , then running the following command will get you the CachyOS August 2024 release:

```

    sudo pacman -Syu

```

For more info, the official [upgrade guide][25] is a handy source of information. If interested in the source code, then you can visit the project's [GitHub][26] repo.
