From 'Just for Fun' to a Full-Fledged Distribution: Aditya Shakya's Archcraft Journey
======
The Archcraft idea started as a passion project, and now it is a
responsibility for the creator. Learn more about the journey here.

I switched to Archcraft from Ubuntu for more than a month now, and it is going well so far. Hassle-free updates, latest Linux kernel, a cool looking desktop, and the solid Arch Linux experience at its core.

If you are hearing about the distro for the first time, let me tell you: **it is a convenient Arch Linux distribution that offers out-of-the-box customizations** , and provides optional premium theme/packages to get a more customizable experience.

The distribution is free, but you can get its premium theme packages or different out-of-the-box configurations for a premium to support its development.

So, it is an interesting idea, and it has been working for a couple of years now. I am intrigued by it, and I'm definitely considering getting a premium theme soon.

_But, how did it all start?_ _What was the motive behind this distro?_

Fret not, I reached out to the Archcraft's creator, **Aditya Shakya** , and he told us more about him and the project.

### _1\. Archcraft is a unique Arch-based distribution that many often recommend for beginners. How did you start the project? What was the motive behind it?_

![][3]

**A** : Well, I’ve tried to create it as easy as possible so that even beginners won’t have issues with it.

How did the project start? Well, simple answer, **just for fun! And the same was the motive.**

There’s a space on Reddit named, _r/unixporn_. I used to rice my Linux Desktop, create configs like polybar, rofi, plymouth themes, and share them there ( _there are repos on my_ [_GitHub profile_][4] _with thousands of stars on them_ ).

![][5]

So just like that, My Arch Linux was already well-riced (for me) and I did not want to rice it all again. Hence, I thought of creating an ISO, which I can extract to my partition ( _like the old way of installing Arch_ ) and start using it instantly.

Initially, there was no installer on it. I just posted the ISO on _r/unixpor_ n, thinking maybe others like the idea, and it can be usable for them as well. People liked it, and later I added a CLI installer to it as well. Back then it was just **custom Arch** , ([here’s the first post][6]).

![][7]

From there, I kept getting good responses and I kept learning and improving the ISO, and then by using all the knowledge I gathered, I turned it into a distribution. That’s it! 😄

### _2\. You utilize an interesting freemium model to provide specific pre-configured window managers or themes for a premium. What kind of interactions have you had with users who pay for the work?_

![][10]

**A:** I get amazing and unexpected responses from people who pay for that.

In fact, there were just a few things available for a premium. Later, after using them, people requested me to make more things.

Like: _**Hey Dev, Why don’t you combine all the Wayland Compositor and turn it into an Archcraft Wayland Flavor, and offer it for less price**_ and I did exactly that.

Of course, there were negative responses as well. Initially, when I started the premium model, there were few people who were like **Linux is free, this is unethical, who would pay for Linux? Etc.**

I believe, those few guys misunderstood the word “FREE” in Linux world. Anyway, so many people ( _whether they are a part of Archcraft or not)_ have defended me and supported me. Apparently, there were people who understood how much time and effort it takes to create a project of that scale.

The work one has to put into maintaining it, updating it and keeping it alive. So here I am, keeping it updated, maintained and alive! 😁

### _3\. What are your future plans with Archcraft? Is it your passion project, or do you intend to make it more than what it is?_

![][11]

**A:** Well, As I’ve mentioned above, yes, **it was just a passion project.** **But now, it’s a responsibility**. So many people use it as a daily driver, as a work machine, etc. Many users send me text messages, emails saying they use Archcraft for this and that and that they appreciate the work that has been done with it. And they ask to keep it alive.

And now, it’s my responsibility to keep it updated. I keep working on it, I continuously add new stuff to it.

![This is where Aditya's magic happens to maintain and build Archcraft][12]

I don’t know if I want to make it more than what it is today, but sure, I’ll keep improving it and let’s see where it goes.

### *4. In addition to Archcraft, what do you work on? *

![][13]

**A:** Well, Archcraft is the work that I love to do.

**I also create custom Linux OS for people all around the world** (I have more than 50 clients globally).

I am studying to get a job as an Elementary School Teacher (As I hold a degree in Education) and occasionally, I help my father with our family business (it’s related to Agriculture).

### _5\. Tell us a little about yourself, and what you like to do in your spare time._

![][14]

**A:** Well, I’m 29 years old. I belong to a semi-rural area in Uttar Pradesh, India. I’ve studied science and math in school (10th & 12th). I have a degree in Computer Science ( **BCA** ) and Education ( **D.EL.ED** ). Furthermore, I used to love art and drawing as a kid, And I got an _**A**_ in the **Intermediate Drawing Grade Examination** (IGD Bombay) competition, back in 2010 (a little something under my belt 😄).

I love gardening and in my spare time, I take care of plants that I have on my rooftop. I’m somebody who loves nature and every day after work, I just go for a walk in the fields, or by the riverbank, just to relax. Being an extreme introvert, I hardly engage in any kind of social gathering, no parties, nothing. Anyway, I guess I'm just BORING 😆

### _6\. Do you like Debian/Ubuntu-based distros? What do you think about them?_

**A** : **I don’t. Of course, it is very much subjective, But I don’t**.

What do I think about them? **Just not my type**. I don’t hate them, either. I don’t know why it’s so hard to explain. I mean of course, like so many of us, I’ve too started my Linux journey with Ubuntu. But, after that, never!

### _7\. As a recommendation to anyone who is not using Arch Linux, what would be your top 3 Linux distributions pick?_

![][15]

**A:** Okay, This is hard to answer. The thing is, I’ve switched to Arch Linux in 2017 and thereafter, I’ve never tried any other distro.

My distro hopping ended there, Until I created my own 😁

I started with Ubuntu in 2013, then used Elementary OS for a year, then KDE Neon.

All of those were based on Ubuntu, But I was never satisfied with any of them.

Then I tried Arch and man, I was in love with that. (it was allowing me to do stuff that a hacker does in Hollywood movies, LOL). Joke aside, It was a perfectly fine distro. It never broke for me, It has everything I need. It was amazing. Still don’t know why people are so afraid to use it. All those allegations for Arch on the internet, they always felt unrelatable to me, Unless except **I Use Arch BTW :)** (which is not an allegation, Just wanted to put it there, LOL)

Anyway, I've been on Arch for the last 8 years and have not used any other distro as my main.

**Though I can tell you which one I like.** **I like** **Void Linux** ( _maybe because it’s so close to Arch_ ). **The second one would be Fedora** , yeah it’s nice ( _not a fan, but people love it_ ) And… That’s it, Can’t think of a 3rd one. But I’m sure there are plenty of good distros out there, I just haven't tried them.

### _8\. Do you have a message for our readers? If someone wants to contribute to your project, what is the best way to approach you regarding that?_

![][16]

**A:** Not Something specific, But I just want to say, In my experience, **Linux-based OS's are the best. You get the freedom with Linux.**

And **I would like to thank all the people who have appreciated and supported Archcraft. Members of the community who have contributed and are still contributing to the development of Archcraft. It was never possible for Archcraft to get where it is today, without the help of those people** , considering it’s a one-man project.

If you want to contribute, there are many ways — **open issues, create PRs,** etc. **If there’s something very specific, anyone can email me**. I might be slow to respond, but I’ll respond.
