With governments around the world increasingly [warming up][3] to the idea of open-source software being used in their offices. Local governments and public organizations in India have been [no stranger][4] to trying out open-source operating systems and tools in their workflows.

One well-known instance of that has been the use of an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution called **KITE GNU Linux** in public schools in the state of [Kerala][5].

Used for a wide variety of use cases, the KITE acronym stands for _Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education_ , which is a [state-owned entity][6] that developed the distro.

According to a [recent report][7], the Kerala government has announced a new KITE GNU Linux release with some noteworthy upgrades. So, let's check it out. 👇

### KITE GNU Linux 22.04: What to Expect?

Introduced as an upgrade to an [earlier release][9], the KITE GNU Linux 22.04 release is based on [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS][10], and can be deployed on the ~300,000 computers in the public schools across Kerala.

This release uses **Wayland as the default session** , with an **extensive application suite** consisting of applications and interactive games like [Krita][11], [PictoBlox][12], [GCompris][13], [Tux Paint][14], etc.

Moreover, they have gone the extra step by introducing some **basic tools for teaching students the concept of AI** , machine learning, computer vision, and other related fields.

Of course, the use of KITE GNU Linux 22.04 is not just limited to the educational setting, and can be used for things like desktop publishing (DTP), 3D animation, sound recording, broadcasting, and more.

### 📥 Get KITE GNU Linux 22.04

At the time of writing, KITE GNU Linux 22.04 was scheduled to be made available at an event on 23 August 2024 ( _around 10:30 a.m_ ) at the KITE [Regional Resource Center][15] in Ernakulam, Kerala.

You can keep an eye on the [official website][16] to grab the 22.04 release after it drops. Currently, it lists the older 20.04 release alongside [GNUKhata][17] and a Lite 2020 release.

Though, I am **unsure how this would perform on a virtual machine** , I think a bare-metal installation would be a better fit for this distro.
