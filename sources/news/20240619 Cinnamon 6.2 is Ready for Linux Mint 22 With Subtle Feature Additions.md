Cinnamon 6.2 is Ready for Linux Mint 22 With Subtle Feature Additions
======
Cinnamon 6.2 isn't a massive upgrade, but it's the one meant for Linux
Mint 22. That makes it exciting!

Cinnamon is a [fantastic, yet underrated][3] Linux desktop environment that features a user interface that does not get in the way and is beginner-friendly.

Of course, many of you might already be users of Cinnamon desktop, thanks to [Linux Mint][4].

So, allow me to take you through some really awesome features that are being introduced with the new **Cinnamon 6.2** release, which has arrived months after the previous [major release][5].

Let's get started.

### Cinnamon 6.2: What to Expect? 🤔

![Cinnamon 6.2 running on EndeavourOS][6]

Packed with many important fixes and improvements, Cinnamon 6.2 brings about things like the workspace switcher now supporting the **closing of workspaces with a middle-click** , a fix for the reported battery status, with reporting of pending charge/discharge states under “ _Power Management_ ”.

Then there's the **new screen lock delay options** to choose from ( _5 or 10 seconds_ ), searchable keybinds, **improved Flatpak support** , a switch to [GNOME Online Accounts GTK][7] and the search bar being shown [by default][8] when choosing an application.

Moreover, **users can now see their profile picture in the panel** , and in case it doesn't load, the placeholder image will be loaded instead. **Cinnamon Spices also received some useful tweaks** like support for keybindings and the preservation of file permissions for downloaded Spices.

#### Other Changes and Improvements

Those were not all the changes, there are a bunch of other notable changes too:

  * A new “Science” category in the menu.
  * New action icon included with the Mint-X theme.
  * Improvements to the window behavior when connecting a monitor.
  * A padlock being shown on the network icons when a VPN connection is active.
  * Addressed a bug for NVIDIA users that caused breakage with Online Accounts.



You can get additional information about this release in the [official changelog][9].

### 📥 Get Cinnamon 6.2

The best way to get this release of Cinnamon would be with the upcoming **Linux Mint 22 “Wilma”** release, which will be based on [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS][10].

But, you will have to wait for it, as it's still undergoing development. Plus, **this iteration of Cinnamon is bound to receive further tweaks** before the final release happens, so you will get a refined experience when it arrives.

**If you can't wait** , then you can either get the source from [GitHub][11], or install a rolling release distro like [EndeavourOS][12], which features this release of Cinnamon.

[Cinnamon 6.2 (GitHub)][11]

The [Arch Linux repo][13] hosts this release, so you can easily get it on any Arch-based distro.
