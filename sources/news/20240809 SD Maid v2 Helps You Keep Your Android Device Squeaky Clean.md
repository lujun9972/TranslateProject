SD Maid v2 Helps You Keep Your Android Device Squeaky Clean
======
SD Maid's open-source successor is a neat utility that you must try!

Android is a versatile operating system, unlike iOS ( _shots fired😉_ ).

So, it is a no-brainer that we get various applications for every inch of our device. Whether you want to check your sensors, save battery, or just want to manage files differently, there is an app for that.

Similarly, to clean up all the junk from apps and system to free up storage space, we have tools to get the job done. And, the successor to one of the most popular options is something that you shouldn't miss, i.e., **SD Maid 2/SE**.

If you are a long-time Android user for a decade or more, chances are, you have used SD Maid (the older app) when exploring options to clean up storage space.

Apps like SD Maid were incredibly useful. I remember purchasing the pro version of it for 10 INR or something in a Black Friday Google Play Store sale. Those were the times! 🥹

### SD Maid 2/SE: A Cleaner App That Ticks All The Boxes

![][3]

**SD Maid 2** is a free and open-source app with optional premium as a successor to its proprietary legacy version.

It offers plenty of controls and features for you to easily claim back the necessary storage space.

The app needs multiple permissions for it to work best, including accessibility access, which is something that can be flagged by Antivirus apps. You can also make use of a rooted device ( _not mandatory_ ) to scan through system files, and get more abilities to clean up temporary system files (or similar).

For starters, you can clean cached data at once, find duplicates, app residuals, logs, and more.

Some key features include:

  * **Removing data that belongs to apps that are no longer installed (CorpseFinder)**
  * **Deleting cached data (AppCleaner)**
  * **Custom rules to clean/whitelist certain files (pro version)**
  * **Scheduling the cleaning tasks (pro version)**
  * **Managing apps/disabling apps (AppControl)**
  * **Analyze storage space**
  * **Fine grain controls to delete WhatsApp or other chat apps data like media cache, duplicate backups, downloads, and more.**

Functionalities like AppCleaner and custom rules can be unlocked with the pro version.

And, it takes a **one-time fee** to unlock the pro features via Play Store or GitHub Sponsors. So, if you like the free functionalities, and want to support the development of the app. You can purchase the pro license for around **3 USD** or 5 USD (via [GitHub][5]).

If you want to support the app with a yearly subscription, you can do that for just around 1 USD per year on the Play Store.

### Install SD Maid 2

You can find SD Maid 2 on the [Google Play Store][6] and [F-Droid][7]. The F-Droid version is free from any Google dependencies. So, you can use it on a de-googled Android OS as well.

I would recommend the Google Play Store version for a cheaper in-app purchase, and flexible options to support the development with a subscription.
