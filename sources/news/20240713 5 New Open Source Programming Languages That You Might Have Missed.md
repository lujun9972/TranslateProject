5 New Open Source Programming Languages That You Might Have Missed!
======
You never know, one of these programming languages can be the next big
thing!
[![][1]][2]

[Programming languages][3] have been one of the most important cornerstones of the modern digital world. These have enabled a wide range of innovations that were previously unseen.

For me, my first experience with programming languages happened when I was pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer applications ( _BCA_ ). I was initially taught the venerable [C][4] programming language, then [C++][5], and by the final year, I had learned [Java][6], with [Python][7] being slowly introduced around the end of term.

Of course, nowadays, things are different for me. I haven't really spent any time coding since 2022, as I slowly transitioned to a more writing-focused line in my career.

Despite that, I try my best to keep an eye out for interesting programming languages, and with this list, I will be showcasing a few that I recently came across. If you are someone who gets excited about the idea of coding and programming languages, you should keep track of some of these intriguing options.

### 1\. Pkl

![][8]

From the house of [Apple][9], Pkl ( _pronounced Pickle_ ) is a declarative programming language that was built as a configuration-as-code implementation with support for rich validation and tooling.

They **introduced this to address the shortcomings of static languages** like YAML, JSON, and Property Lists, when configuration became more complex.

Some **key features** include:

  * Apache-2.0 License
  * Great IDE Integration
  * Can be used as a Command Line Tool



You can go to its [official website][10] and the [documentation][11] to get started with it. For those interested in the source code, they can refer to its [GitHub repo][12].

### 2\. Lax

![][13]

This is one of the newest programming languages in this list that was introduced on [Reddit][14] a few months ago by its lead developer as ‚Äú _a programming language where the syntax is whatever you want it to b_ e‚Äù.

Being an **under-development bit of kit** , Lax was created because its creator felt that the way other languages parse and interpret code is ‚Äú _unnecessarily strict_ ‚Äù.

They wanted to demonstrate that it was possible to build a language with highly loose/flexible syntax that wouldn't sacrifice on the level of performance and control offered by lower-level languages.

Some **key features** include:

  * GPL-3.0 License
  * Runs on a Virtual Machine
  * Highly Extensible Syntax and Grammar



If this interests you, then you can get started with it by heading to its [GitHub][15] repo ( _complax_ ), which features both the compiler and virtual machine for it.

[Lax][15]

### 3\. Amber

![][16]

Amber is a programming language that [makes Bash scripting easier][17] by **allowing users to write Bash scripts in a high-level programming language** , closer to what a human might understand easily.

In our testing, Amber was easily able to generate functional Bash scripts that worked as expected, without any hiccups.

Some **key features** include:

  * GPL-3.0 License
  * Based on ECMAScript Syntax
  * Type-Safe, Runtime-Safe Language



Those intrigued by this programming language can refer to its [official website][18] and [documentation][19] to get started with it. If you are interested in the source code, then give its [GitHub][20] repo a visit.

### 4\. Scrapscript

![][22]

Marketed by its developer as a programming language that ‚Äú _solves the software shareability problem_ ‚Äù, Scrapscript is meant to make software safe and sharable.

It does so with various elements that bring all this together. Take, for instance, the content-addressable nature of it, **chunks of the language called ‚Äú _scraps_ ‚Äù can be replaced with a hash**, which can then be globally distributed in something called ‚Äúscrapyards‚Äù that replace traditional package management.

Some **key features** include:

  * MIT License
  * Highly Modular Nature
  * Immutable Dependencies



If this is something that interests you, then you can head to its [official website][23] to get started. They also have a [guide][24] that's quite helpful, and the source code is hosted on [GitHub][25].

### 5\. Knowledge Graph Language

![][26]

[Knowledge graphs][27] are a type of knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model to handle data. You have most likely come across this when you used a search engine like Google, where these are used to serve up answers to commonly asked questions quickly, without the need for further input by the user.

Fascinated by how these work, [James][28], a developer and technical marketer, set out to build a query language for knowledge graphs, and Knowledge Graph Language (KGL) is the result of that.

With KGL, **you can interact with knowledge graphs in a straightforward way** , carrying out tasks such as returning all connecting nodes, finding out how two separate nodes connect, and finding all attributes related to a node in a graph.

Some **key features** include:

  * MIT License
  * Supports Semantic Triples
  * Based on Python & HTML



You can learn more about KGL by going over the [recent blog][29] by its lead developer, and its [GitHub][30] repo, where you will find a helpful README and access to the source code.
