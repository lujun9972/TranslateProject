Flappy Bird's Unofficial Clone is Open-Source: Here's How to Try
======
A 100 KB sized open-source Flappy Bird clone. What else do you need in
2024?

I remember back in the day, when [Flappy Bird][3] first came into my circle of friends, how painful it was to score even a single point. I used to try going ahead but would inevitably bump into one of the pipes, only to see one of my friends do it like a pro.

That's enough talk about my past shenanigans. Now, there is some news for fans of Flappy Bird which might make them revisit the game.

**What's Happening:** Thanks to the work of [Vadim Boev][4], there is now **a** [**C**][5] **-based, free, and open-source version of Flappy Bird** , that doesn't annoy you with crypto or bombard you with ads.

Currently, the Flappy Bird clone doesn't feature a license of any kind, and that's probably because the [Flappy Bird Foundation][6] owns the trademark for it ( _who are not related to the original creator_ ). But, you can view the code freely if you'd like.

I sincerely hope the lead developer changes its branding so that it is more accessible via app stores like F-Droid and the Play Store. As of now, there is only a signed APK.

**What To Expect:** A clone of the original Flappy Bird game, of course. I tested it on an Android 12 smartphone, and it worked really well. It was just that the [hitbox][7] for the bird was rather too big, resulting in me inadvertently hitting those pesky pipes.

![I managed to get a very high score of 3! I am happy with that. 😏][8]

**How To Get:** The lead developer ( _and the only one, from what I can see_ ) has been consistently pushing updates to this FOSS version of Flappy Bird. You can grab the latest release ( _signed APK_ ) from the project's [GitHub][9] repo, which comes in under a minuscule **100 KB**.

If you are interested in learning what made Vadim develop this and how they were able to achieve it, then you should give the project's [README][11] a read.

_💬 I never expected Flappy Bird to make a comeback like this (the crypto-riddled remake doesn't count). What about you? Will you try this out?_
