Figma Alternative Penpot 2.0 Adds Tons of New Features to its Open-Source Platform
======
Penpot 2.0 makes it an amazing open-source Figma alternative. What do
you think?
Even though Adobe's acquisition of Figma [failed][1], many users did feel the need to switch to [free and open-source Figma alternatives][2], fearing how the prospective owners might handle their beloved web-based designing platform.

One such alternative that took a chunk out of [Figma][3] has been the open-source design tool [Penpot][4], which now claims to serve **over 600,000 professionals and 120,000 teams** across the globe who use the platform to design all kinds of things.

And, we [covered it][5] back then when it released.

Now, Penpot has a milestone 2.0 release with much-awaited improvements. Let's see what it has to offer.

## 🆕 Penpot 2.0: What's New?

Announced as a major release, Penpot 2.0 brings about **support for CSS Grid Layouts** , which allows designers to easily create intuitive layouts while also allowing granular control over those with the added advantage of outputting developer-friendly code.

The **user interface also sees an overhaul** that was put together with accessibility in mind. For instance, the toolbar was moved to the top part of the interface, there are now dedicated panels for options such as the components, the new grid layout feature, and more.

Moreover, there is **better iconography and typography** , **collapsible menus** , **improved reading contrast** , and the **ability to navigate just by using the keyboard**.

You can explore more about the redesigned UI through a separate official video walk through:

The component libraries also see an upgrade, with a new data structure being implemented to better cater to designers. It also scales better now for larger deployments, thanks to being more modular in nature.

Penpot 2.0 also **features HTML markup for existing SVG and CSS styles** and an “ _image as fill_ ” option to preserve image ratios. During the launch of this release, Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz, CEO of Penpot added that:

> Penpot 2.0 is an open-source product that fosters collaboration by breaking down barriers between designers and devs.

> Born from user needs, our design-as-code approach creates a shared language and set of standards that unifies the development process and accelerates the creation of high-quality products.

  * Various performance optimizations.
  * A new menu option to toggle between the light/dark themes.
  * Keyboard shortcut for sending comments with “ _Ctrl+Enter_ ” or “ _Cmd+Enter_ ”.
  * Fix for a crash when picking a recently used gradient color for a new color in the assets tab.
