Linux Mint 22 Release Delayed Due to Nasty Bugs!
======
Linux Mint fans, you will have to wait a bit more...
[![][1]][2]

Ever since [Cinnamon 6.2][3] came out, the race has been on to ship the upcoming Linux Mint 22 “Wilma” release, with the best levels of refinements possible during the phase of development.

If you didn't know, it is a [long-term support][4] release ( _until 2029_ ) based on Ubuntu 24.04, and is a big one for the developers to get up and running on schedule.

Sadly, they have hit a nest of bugs that have pushed its release date further.

### Linux Mint 22: Pesky Bugs Be Gone

![Tux is sad because of this][5]

Announced in [a blog][6] by Clement Lefebvre ( _CLEM_ ), he shared that **they had received over 100 reports that contained bugs and quirks of different kinds** for the beta build of Linux Mint 22. But, some were more critical than others.

Take, for instance, the Flatpak/Mint Install issues, crashes during AppArmor security changes, and hardware acceleration playback libraries making Xorg crash.

Needless to say, **the developers are happy that they got this kind of feedback** before the stable release, and they are working on addressing issues on a one-by-one basis, pushing updates as they progress.

If all that made you curious, then you can take a look for yourself and judge what's happening. The [mint22-beta][7] repo on GitHub houses all the open and closed issues posted by various users.

If you want to test the beta build of Linux Mint 22, then you can do so by referring to an [earlier blog][8].

However, fret not, as Clem also mentioned that **Linux Mint 22 is still coming in July 2024** , it has just been delayed by a few weeks, longer than the usual 2-week beta phase.
