======
Get multiple DRM-free Linux and DevOps ebooks from just $1 in this time
sensitive deal. What else can you ask for?

[Humble Bundle is offering premium Linux and DevOps ebooks from O'Reilly.][3]

This is ideal if you want to master the Linux command line, bootstrap yourself into DevOps competency, and gain a whole bunch of other skills to make you a better sysadmin.

The best thing is that you don't have to burn a hole in your pocket.

### Enhance your Linux skills in just $1

![][4]

For just $1, you get the following books:

  * Learning Modern Linux
  * Network Programmability & Automation
  * Kubernetes Up & Running
  * Learning Git
  * Learning GitHub Actions



Learning Modern Linux or Kubernetes Up & Running itself is worth more than $1.

### Want more?

Want more books? The price increases now. For $18, you get 10 books. The 5 books you saw above and the following 5 books:

And if you pay $25, you get 15 books. The above 10 and the following 5 books additionally:

### Win-win! Improve your Linux skill and support a charity

I like Humble Bundle for two things:

  * The eBooks are DRM-free. You own them forever and can use them on any device. This is unlike buying ebooks from Kindle, which can only run on Kindle devices.
  * Humble shares part of each sale with a non-profit charity. You can even configure the percentage of sale between charity, Humble and the publisher of the eBooks.



The present Linux for Seasoned Sysadmins bundle supports non-profit organization [Code for America][7].

[Get Humble Bundle Linux Deal][3]

As for me, I got the first bundle as I already had a few books from the bigger bundles. I look forward to learning Kubernetes.

I let you explore the offering. Please do remember that this is a limited time deal and it will end in 10 days.
