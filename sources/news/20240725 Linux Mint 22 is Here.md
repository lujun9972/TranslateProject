Linux Mint 22 is Here!
======
Linux Mint 22 has finally arrived!
[![][1]][2]

Linux Mint 22 is the next most exciting distro release after Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, at least, for me.

Linux Mint always manages to do things different and arguably better than Ubuntu. We have an article stating some [reasons Linux Mint is better][3] if you are curious.

If you are a Linux Mint fan or a user, you probably already know that.

That being said, the latest release of Linux Mint 22 based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS has finally arrived!

What is new? How can you upgrade from an existing Linux Mint system? I will tell you all about it here.

### Desktop Environment Updates

![][4]

Cinnamon 6.2 steals the spotlight with Linux Mint 22 flagship edition. There are numerous technical refinements that make your experience faster and secure with it.

You can expect things like the ability to close a workspace using the middle-mouse button, a profile picture in the panel, and GNOME Online Accounts GTK, and more. Read our original coverage on [Cinnamon 6.2 features][5] for all the details:

For other editions, we have Xfce 4.18 and MATE 1.28.

Xfce 4.18 benefits from all the goodies, and also lets you customize its icon on the tray bar:

### Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Base

The previous release of Linux Mint 21.x was based on the older Ubuntu LTS base.

Now, you can benefit from the newest Ubuntu 24.04 LTS base that comes with a range of improvements, and a **support cycle until 2029.**

While the changes for Canonical's [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS][8] may not be present in Linux Mint 22, the core benefits remain intact.

### Feature Additions

You can expect a couple of discussion-worthy feature updates. The biggest ones include:

  * **Unverified Flatpak packages** **disabled by default**
  * **A** **new Nemo actions menu editor**.
  * **Ability to change sticky note position.**
  * **Audio server switched to Pipewire.**
  * **A new matrix app.**



There are various subtle changes throughout, you can find more details on the new Linux Mint 22 features here:

### Linux Kernel 6.8

![][9]

The standard ISO features [Linux kernel 6.8][10]. You can expect support for newer AMD graphics and Intel Xe graphics hardware with this release.

You can expect the edge ISO with a newer Linux kernel later when it is available.

### Download Linux Mint 22

To get the latest Linux Mint release, you may head over to the [official website][11] where you will find three editions; **Cinnamon** , **MATE** , and **Xfce**.

#### ⚙️ Upgrade from Older Release

First and foremost, ensure that you have backed up all your data using a system snapshot tool like [Timeshift][12]. Then, fire up the “ _Update Manager_ ” and click on the “ _Refresh_ ” button to check for new version of “ _mintupdate_ ” or “ _mint-upgrade-info_ ”, then apply updates, if there are any.

Now, go into the “ _Edit_ ” menu and click on _Upgrade to “Linux Mint 22 Wilma”_ to get started with the system upgrade.

📋

The upgrade might take a while to be available for Linux Mint 22. You can keep an eye on the [official Linux Mint blog][14] as they publish the official upgrade instructions soon.
