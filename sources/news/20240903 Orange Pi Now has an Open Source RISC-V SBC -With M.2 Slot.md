Orange Pi Now has an Open Source RISC-V SBC [With M.2 Slot]
======
A pretty interesting RISC-V powered SBC for tinkerers and developers.
[![][1]][2]

The market for [single-board computers][3] (SBCs) is an ever-evolving one, with constant innovations being made to improve their function and reliability.

One of the most recent advances has been the introduction of boards powered by the open-source [RISC-V][4] architecture, marking a slow move away from the industry standard, [Arm][5].

Some popular names that have begun shipping RISC-V-powered SBCs are [ArmSoM][6] and [Milk-V][7], who have a wide range of products to cater to various use cases, including AI.

Another name in the SBC space that comes to mind is [Orange Pi][8]; they have been around for some time, and know the market quite well. But, they never had a RISC-V product.

Well, that changes now. 😃

### Orange Pi RV: What to Expect?

![][9]

Marking the Shenzhen-based outfit's entry into the RISC-V ecosystem, the Orange Pi RV is a compact SBC that has been **designed to be high-performing** but with low-power features and a capable GPU that can do H.264/H.265 video encoding/decoding.

The RISC-V chip it uses is the same one as found on the [Milk-V Mars][10], with Orange Pi pointing out that it **can run Linux distributions** , pointing to Debian Linux on its [download page][11].

At the time of writing this, it was not available to download yet. So, you can wait it out before you can find a supported image.

Some **key specs** include:

  * **CPU:** StarFive JH7110 with 4x RV64GC cores running @1.5 GHz
  * **RAM:** 2 GB/4 GB/8 GB LPDDR4 @2800 MT/s
  * **Power:** Type-C 5V/4A power supply
  * **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 5.0 + BT 5.0
  * **GPU:** RISC-V architecture
  * **Weight:** 54 g



**Potential use cases** for the Orange Pi RV include things like real-time processing on edge, complex image/video processing, intelligent visual computing, industrial automation, video surveillance, traffic control, and more.

![Orange Pi RV ports.][12]

On the **I/O port** side of things, the Orange Pi RV has a bunch:

  * 4x USB 3.0
  * 1x HDMI 2.0
  * 1x Gigabit Ethernet
  * 40-pin GPIO header
  * 1x 3.5 mm (no mic support)
  * 1x M.2 M-key 2280 (with support for PCIe 2.0)



#### 💰 Pricing and Availability

At the time of writing, the Orange Pi RV was listed on the [official website][13] and [Amazon][14] ( _partner link_ ), but **was not available for purchase**. I suggest you keep an eye out for when it comes in stock on those two sites.
